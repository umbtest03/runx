# Charge Challenge

Turn a priced provider-side operation into a typed `payment_required` signal.

This skill formats the challenge that a caller must satisfy before a paid tool
operation can proceed. It carries the priced bounds, idempotency key, accepted
settlement families, and provider hints. It does not price the operation,
verify returned credentials, collect funds, or forward the upstream tool call.

## Quality Profile

- Purpose: expose priced provider-side payment requirements without widening
  authority.
- Audience: caller agents, provider harnesses, operators, and registry tooling.
- Artifact contract: `payment_required_signal`, `charge_challenge`,
  `idempotency`, `accepted_settlement_families`, and `open_questions`.
- Evidence bar: challenge amounts and families must match the price packet and
  provider policy.
- Strategic bar: preserve idempotency and accepted-family clarity before any
  credential verification starts.
- Stop conditions: return `needs_agent` when priced authority, idempotency, or
  accepted settlement families are missing.

## Output

- `payment_required_signal`: typed challenge signal for the caller.
- `charge_challenge`: provider charge challenge details.
- `idempotency`: challenge key and replay policy.
- `accepted_settlement_families`: settlement families the provider will verify.
- `open_questions`: missing data that blocks safe challenge emission.

## Inputs

- `charge_price_packet` (required): output from `charge-price`.
- `provider_policy` (optional): challenge formatting hints.
- `idempotency_seed` (optional): stable seed if the price packet lacks one.
