# Nitrosend

Use this as the single public Runx surface for Nitrosend customer operations.
It calls the live Nitrosend MCP boundary through a bounded provider adapter;
API keys are delivered as credentials, never accepted as skill inputs or
returned in receipts.

This skill is not for Nitrosend customer-support administration or team Slack
work. Those are product-operator concerns owned by the Nitrosend repository.

## Choose the runner

- `status` (default): live account, brand, sender, domain, provider, warmup, and
  deliverability readiness.
- `analytics`: live account, campaign, flow, or message insights.
- `review-delivery`: read-only content and preflight review.
- `plan-campaign`, `plan-flow`, `plan-transactional`, `compose-email`, and
  `plan-import`: bounded agent judgment. These produce a reviewable request;
  they do not claim provider completion.
- `apply-draft`: apply exact reviewed arguments for a campaign, flow, template,
  or segment draft. It never sends or activates.
- `approve-delivery`: approve a reviewed campaign or flow without delivering.
- `send-campaign`: send or schedule an already-approved campaign after a fresh
  provider review and explicit approval.
- `activate-flow`: activate an already-approved flow after a fresh review and
  explicit approval.
- `send-transactional`: dry-run or send one idempotent message to one recipient.
- `import-contacts`: dry-run or import at most 100 inline consented records.
- `import-contacts-csv`: validate or upload a local CSV through Nitrosend's
  authorized direct-upload path. File bytes and signed URLs never enter the
  agent packet or receipt.
- `import-status`: make one bounded status read for an asynchronous import.
- `segment-from-prose`: internal planning lane for the current supported filter
  catalog; unsupported filters are rejected rather than approximated.

Use the current public `https://nitrosend.com/SKILL.md`, `nitro_get_status`, and
the live MCP schema as product truth. Do not copy onboarding or tool schemas
into another repo-local skill.

## Safe operating sequence

1. Run `status` and stop on sender, domain, suspension, warmup, or account
   blockers.
2. Use a planning runner only where content or audience judgment is needed.
   Apply its exact reviewed MCP arguments with `apply-draft`.
3. Run `review-delivery` before approval. Use `approve-delivery` separately so
   retries never combine approval-state mutation with recipient delivery.
4. Use `send-campaign` or `activate-flow` only after provider approval state is
   established. A fresh review and Runx approval gate are mandatory.
5. Give every real transactional send, campaign delivery, and import a stable
   idempotency key. Reuse that key after a timeout; do not mint a new one.
6. Treat completion as real only when the sealed receipt contains Nitrosend
   provider evidence. A plan receipt is not proof of send, schedule, activation,
   or import.

## Contact import rules

Every import requires a stable `source_id` and a plain-language
`consent_basis`. Purchased, scraped, or data-broker lists are refused.

For CSV imports, pass an absolute `.csv` path. The adapter computes metadata and
checksum locally, reserves an authorized upload, streams the file directly to
the returned public HTTPS host, finalizes with the signed ID, and discards the
signed URL. The import is asynchronous; call `import-status` again as needed
rather than keeping a resident polling loop.

## Stop conditions

- Missing provider credential or brand context.
- Unsupported operation, audience, segment filter, or lifecycle transition.
- Missing consent source, recipient, schedule time, or idempotency key.
- Failed provider review or preflight.
- Missing or denied approval.
- Any request to expose credentials, signed upload URLs, raw contact files, or
  unbounded provider responses.
- Any claim of completion without provider readback evidence.
