# Evaluate Skill

Judge whether a skill is ready to trust, adopt, or publish.

This skill evaluates one bounded capability. It should identify what the skill
does well, where it is incomplete, what evidence supports the trust level, and
what tests or governance gaps block adoption.

Avoid generic praise. The output should help an operator decide whether to
adopt, publish, sandbox, or reject the skill.

## Output

- `capability_profile`: what the skill appears to do and how it executes.
- `trust_assessment`: trust tier, caveats, and missing evidence.
- `test_matrix`: concrete checks the skill should pass.
- `recommendation_report`: adoption or publication recommendation.

## Inputs

- `skill_ref` (required): skill package path, registry id, or marketplace id.
- `objective` (optional): what the operator wants to know about this skill.
- `evidence_pack` (optional): receipts, docs, harness output, or source notes.
- `test_constraints` (optional): time, environment, or safety limits.
