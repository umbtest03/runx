# Payment Reserve

Turn a quote packet into a reservation decision.

This skill presents the human-readable decision record around a payment: what
will be paid, why, under which cap, with which idempotency key, and which child
authority term may reach a rail skill. It does not call a payment rail and does
not store payment truth outside the harness.

Core remains the authority. The reservation is valid only when runx proves that
the child payment term is a subset of the parent grant and records the selected
Decision. This skill names that decision surface and prepares the packet that
the runtime can enforce.

## Quality Profile

- Purpose: create a reviewable reservation packet that can become a runx
  Decision and child payment authority term.
- Audience: the parent harness, approval gate, operator, and rail child
  harness.
- Artifact contract: `payment_decision`, `reserved_payment_authority`,
  `idempotency`, `approval`, `core_requirements`, and `open_questions`.
- Evidence bar: carry the quote id, source refs, parent authority ref, cap, and
  approval status through the output.
- Voice bar: direct operator language. State whether the payment is selected,
  declined, blocked, or needs approval.
- Strategic bar: reserve exactly the quoted amount or a narrower cap; never
  broaden counterparty, rail, realm, operation, period, or currency.
- Stop conditions: return `needs_agent` if approval, parent authority,
  idempotency key, or quote evidence is missing.

## Output

- `payment_decision`: selected/deferred/declined payment decision summary.
- `reserved_payment_authority`: child `payment` authority term for the rail
  harness.
- `spend_capability_ref`: scoped single-use spend capability reference when
  the selected child term includes `spend`.
- `idempotency`: reservation key and recovery lookup fields.
- `approval`: approval status and threshold explanation.
- `core_requirements`: enforcement requirements core must verify.
- `open_questions`: unresolved blockers.

## Inputs

- `payment_quote_packet` (required): output from `payment-quote`.
- `parent_payment_authority` (required): parent authority term or reference.
- `spend_policy` (optional): caller policy limits and approval thresholds.
- `approval_context` (optional): operator, system, or prior approval evidence.
- `idempotency_seed` (optional): stable seed if not already in the quote.
