# X402 Refund

Compose refund quote, refund reserve, optional approval, and a modeled
same-family refund settlement using a static profile example.

This graph profile documents the future unpinned refund surface. In v1 it is
static registry shape only: no dynamic runtime dispatch and no live rail
mutation.

## Quality Profile

- Purpose: show the unpinned provider-side refund graph without hiding receipt
  linkage or same-family refusal.
- Audience: operators, registry tooling, and future runtime implementers.
- Artifact contract: `refund_quote_packet`, `refund_reservation_packet`,
  `refund_approval`, and `refund_rail_packet`.
- Evidence bar: every step carries the original receipt ref, selected family,
  refund idempotency key, and proof ref.
- Strategic bar: keep dynamic dispatch out of v1 until runtime owns it.
- Stop conditions: stop before settlement when the requested family does not
  match the original receipt family.

## Inputs

- `original_receipt_ref` (required): linked sealed charge receipt reference.
- `original_receipt` (required): redacted original charge receipt summary.
- `refund_request` (required): requested amount and reason.
- `parent_payment_authority` (required): parent payment authority term or ref.
- `approval_context` (optional): prior approval evidence.
- `idempotency_seed` (optional): stable refund idempotency seed.
