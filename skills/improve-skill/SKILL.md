# Improve Skill

Review a failed or suspicious run and draft the next bounded improvement.

This is a composite skill that graphs `review-receipt` into `write-harness`.
It takes failure evidence — a receipt, harness output, or manual summary —
diagnoses the root cause, and produces an updated skill proposal with
replayable fixtures that cover the failure.

## What this skill does

1. **Review the failure** (via `review-receipt`). Analyzes the receipt or
   harness output to identify the root cause. Classifies the failure,
   distinguishes symptoms from root cause, and produces a verdict with
   bounded improvement proposals.

2. **Author updated fixtures** (via `write-harness`). Takes the review
   output and drafts an updated skill spec, execution plan if needed,
   and harness fixtures that specifically cover the diagnosed failure.
   The new fixtures serve as acceptance checks for the fix.

## When to use this skill

- A skill run failed and you need to understand why and what to fix.
- A harness test is failing and you need to update the skill or fixtures.
- A receipt shows suspicious behavior (partial success, unexpected output)
  and you want a structured improvement proposal.

## When not to use this skill

- For designing a new skill from scratch — use `design-skill`.
- For general research — use `prior-art`.
- When you already know the fix — just make the change directly.

## Improvement philosophy

Prefer the smallest change that materially improves the skill. One
failure should produce one fix, not an architectural rewrite. If the
review reveals multiple independent issues, propose them as separate
improvements, not a bundled change.

## Quality Profile

- Purpose: convert failure evidence into one bounded, testable improvement.
- Audience: skill maintainers deciding what to fix next.
- Artifact contract: root-cause review, improvement proposal, updated
  acceptance checks, and harness fixtures that reproduce or prevent the failure.
- Evidence bar: tie every proposed change to receipt data, harness output,
  source notes, or the current skill contract. Do not invent a rewrite because
  a failure is inconvenient.
- Voice bar: direct engineering review. No vague "improve robustness" language
  without a concrete failing behavior and fixture.
- Strategic bar: prefer the smallest fix that strengthens the skill's trust
  boundary, content quality, contract clarity, or runtime correctness.
- Stop conditions: return `no_change`, `needs_more_evidence`, or
  `needs_human` when the receipt does not support a bounded fix.

## Inputs

All inputs are optional. Supply whichever evidence is available:

- `receipt_id`: receipt id to inspect. The receipt contains step statuses,
  inputs, outputs, scope decisions, and timing.
- `receipt_summary`: sanitized receipt or failure summary when the full
  receipt is not available.
- `harness_output`: sanitized harness output or assertion failure text.
- `skill_path`: path to the skill package being improved. The review
  step will read the SKILL.md and execution profile to understand the contract.
- `objective`: operator intent for the improvement pass. Guides the
  review toward specific aspects of the failure.
