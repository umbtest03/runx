description: Wrap a borrowed Anthropic SKILL.md under a governed runx overlay, with scope bounds, an allowed-tool set, and a pinned digest, so the open skill ecosystem can run under runx authority without editing the upstream skill.

# Overlay Generator

Make any borrowed skill safe to run by wrapping it in a governed overlay.

The open ecosystem is full of `SKILL.md` files. They carry capability and no
governance. An overlay is how runx adopts one without forking it: a same-schema
`X.yaml` that `wraps` the borrowed skill and adds the runx envelope, scope
bounds, an explicit allowed-tool set, and a pinned content digest. The upstream
skill is never edited; the overlay governs it. This skill authors that overlay
and reports the diagnostics that decide whether it is safe to run.

## What this skill does

1. **Resolve the wrapped skill.** Take a registry ref (`vendor/research@1.2.0`)
   or a local path (`./vendor/research/SKILL.md`) and confirm it resolves.
2. **Pin the content.** Record a digest of the wrapped `SKILL.md` so a later
   upstream change is detected, not silently inherited.
3. **Bound the authority.** Propose the narrowest scopes and the explicit
   allowed-tool set the skill needs; an empty scope set is a diagnostic, not a
   default-allow.
4. **Emit the overlay.** Produce a canonical
   `skills-overlays/<vendor>/<skill>/X.yaml` that wraps the skill and carries the
   runx envelope, plus the diagnostics that gate it.

## Core principles

- **Wrap, never fork.** The overlay references the upstream skill; it does not
  copy or edit it.
- **Most-restrictive-wins.** Effective scopes are the intersection of any graph
  step scopes and the overlay's runner scopes; the overlay can only narrow.
- **Pin the digest.** A borrowed skill is pinned by content digest so an
  upstream edit raises `runx.overlay.digest.stale` instead of running unseen
  changes.
- **No empty grant.** An overlay with no scopes is `runx.overlay.scope.empty`,
  never an implicit allow-all.
- **Wraps is governance, not inheritance.** The overlay does not adopt the
  upstream skill's behavior; it bounds it.

## When to use this skill

- Adopting a third-party or Anthropic-standard skill into a governed runx graph.
- Pinning a borrowed skill so upstream drift is detected.
- Tightening the scopes a borrowed skill runs under.

## When not to use this skill

- To author a first-party skill from scratch (use `design-skill`).
- To change the wrapped skill's behavior. Overlays bound; they do not patch.

## The overlay model

The proposal fills a `skills-overlays/<vendor>/<skill>/X.yaml`:

```yaml
skill: vendor/research
wraps: vendor/research@1.2.0          # or { path: ./vendor/research/SKILL.md, version: sha256:<digest> }
runners:
  default:
    type: agent
    scopes:
      - web.read
      - repo.read
    runx:
      allowed_tools:
        - web.search
        - fs.read
```

Graphs must reference the overlay, never the raw `SKILL.md`. Direct raw
`SKILL.md` invocation is allowed only for interactive human CLI runs, with a
warning.

## Diagnostics

- `runx.overlay.skill.missing` (error): the wrapped ref or path does not resolve.
- `runx.overlay.digest.stale` (warning): the local wrapped digest no longer
  matches the pinned digest.
- `runx.overlay.scope.empty` (error): the overlay declares no scopes.
- `runx.overlay.tools.unbounded` (warning): scopes are declared but no explicit
  `allowed_tools` set bounds them.

## Quality Profile

- Purpose: produce one governed overlay that lets a borrowed skill run under runx
  authority without editing it.
- Audience: the author adopting the skill and the reviewer approving the bound.
- Artifact contract: the overlay (wraps + scopes + allowed tools + pinned
  digest) and the diagnostics that gate it.
- Evidence bar: resolve the wrapped skill and pin its digest; derive scopes from
  what the skill actually needs, never an allow-all.
- Voice bar: direct authoring review; lead with the wrapped ref and the bound.
- Strategic bar: the narrowest scope and tool set that lets the skill do its job.
- Stop conditions: `needs_input` when neither a ref nor a path is given;
  `runx.overlay.skill.missing` blocks a `ready` decision.

## Output schema (`overlay_proposal`)

```yaml
decision: ready | needs_input | reject
wraps:
  ref: string                          # vendor/research@1.2.0, when from registry
  path: string                         # ./vendor/research/SKILL.md, when local
  digest: string                       # sha256:<digest> pin
overlay_path: string                   # skills-overlays/<vendor>/<skill>/X.yaml
runner:
  type: agent | agent-task
  scopes: [string]
  allowed_tools: [string]
diagnostics:
  - id: string
    severity: error | warning
    message: string
rationale: string
blockers: [string]
needs_input: [string]
success_checkpoint:
  milestone: string
  description: string
```

A proposal with any `error` diagnostic must not be `ready`.

## Worked example

Wrap the borrowed `vendor/research@1.2.0` skill so a docs graph can call it. The
overlay pins the digest, binds `type: agent` with scopes `web.read` and
`repo.read`, and an allowed-tool set of `web.search` and `fs.read`. The wrapped
ref resolves and the scopes are non-empty, so the lint is clean and the decision
is `ready`. The graph then references
`skills-overlays/vendor/research/X.yaml`, never the raw `SKILL.md`.

## Inputs

- `skill_ref` (optional): a registry ref, e.g. `vendor/research@1.2.0`.
- `skill_path` (optional): a local path to a borrowed `SKILL.md`.
- `scope_intent` (optional): what the skill should be allowed to do, in prose.
- `objective` (optional): operator intent that focuses the bound.

At least one of `skill_ref` or `skill_path` is required; with neither, the skill
returns `needs_input`.
