# Open-Meteo Weather Forecast

Fetch global place, forecast, and air-quality evidence through runx's governed
HTTP front. The skill never performs an ad-hoc fetch. Each stage is a bounded,
read-only HTTP runner whose endpoint, inputs, status, authority scope, and
output packet are recorded in the sealed receipt. Open-Meteo requires no API key
and covers the whole globe, so this is the worldwide counterpart to the US-only
`nws-weather-forecast` provider.

## Procedure

1. Run `locate` with a city or place name.
2. Select the intended result and preserve its latitude, longitude, timezone,
   and country as a typed provider-evidence packet.
3. Run the default `forecast` runner with the selected coordinates.
4. Require a 2xx response and preserve the provider URL, timezone, generation
   time, current conditions, daily forecast, and receipt references.
5. Treat the result as context only. Any notification, scheduling change, or
   operational mutation requires a separate skill and authority gate.

## Inputs

- `name` (`locate`, required): city or place to resolve.
- `count` (`locate`, optional): maximum candidate results, default `5`.
- `latitude` (`forecast`, required): decimal latitude.
- `longitude` (`forecast`, required): decimal longitude.
- `forecast_days` (`forecast`, optional): days requested, default `3`.

## Output packets

Two runners are exposed. The default `main` runner runs `locate` then
`forecast`. The `air_quality` runner runs `locate` then `air_quality`. Each
graph step produces a typed sealed packet:

- `locate` produces Open-Meteo geocoding provider evidence.
- `forecast` produces Open-Meteo forecast provider evidence.
- `air_quality` produces Open-Meteo air-quality provider evidence (PM2.5, PM10,
  carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, ozone, and the European
  and US air-quality indices).

Preserve provider metadata and receipt references when passing either packet to
another skill. Do not convert provider evidence into high-stakes advice.

## Failure, retry, and stop conditions

- **Ambiguous or missing place:** return `needs_input`; do not silently choose a
  similarly named location.
- **Invalid coordinates or forecast-days value:** return `needs_input`.
- **Non-2xx response, timeout, or rate limit:** return `needs_more_evidence`,
  preserve the failure in the receipt, and retry only under the caller's retry
  policy.
- **Stale or incomplete provider response:** return `needs_more_evidence`.
- **Life-safety, medical, aviation, maritime, or emergency use:** refuse and
  direct the caller to official channels.
- **Mutation requested from forecast evidence:** stop after the sealed read and
  require a separate authority-scoped action skill.

## Worked example

1. Run `locate` with `name: Shanghai`.
2. Select the result for Shanghai, China.
3. Run `forecast` using the sealed latitude and longitude with
   `forecast_days: "3"`.
4. Preserve both sealed receipts with the returned forecast evidence.
