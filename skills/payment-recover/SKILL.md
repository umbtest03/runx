# Payment Recover

Inspect a payment idempotency key after a crash, timeout, retry, or ambiguous
rail response.

This skill is the recovery surface for agent payments. It answers one question:
has this reserved payment already reached a rail outcome that can be sealed, or
is a retry still safe? It must prefer reconciliation over mutation.

It does not spend. It does not decide success without a proof ref. It reports
ambiguous states as escalation.

## Quality Profile

- Purpose: prevent double-spend and preserve receipt-before-success after
  partial failures.
- Audience: runtime harness, operator, receipt verifier, and rail implementer.
- Artifact contract: `recovery_assessment`, `rail_lookup`, `proof_refs`,
  `recommended_action`, and `open_questions`.
- Evidence bar: tie every recovered outcome to the idempotency key,
  reservation decision, rail profile, and proof ref.
- Voice bar: terse incident/recovery language.
- Strategic bar: make the safe next action obvious: seal recovered proof,
  retry once under the same key, decline, or escalate.
- Stop conditions: return `escalate` when rail state cannot prove success,
  failure, or safe retry.

## Output

- `recovery_assessment`: recovered, retry_safe, failed, or ambiguous.
- `rail_lookup`: what was queried and which idempotency key was used.
- `proof_refs`: recovered rail proof refs, if any.
- `recommended_action`: seal, retry_same_key, decline, or escalate.
- `open_questions`: unresolved state that blocks safe execution.

## Inputs

- `idempotency` (required): reservation key and recovery lookup fields.
- `reserved_payment_authority` (required): child payment authority term.
- `rail_profile_ref` (required): configured rail profile reference.
- `prior_rail_result` (optional): previous rail attempt result.
- `receipt_refs` (optional): existing harness or rail proof refs.
