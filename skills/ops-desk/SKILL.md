# Ops Desk

Operate a project, workspace, or account from an agent-controlled desk.

This skill is the generic operations desk layer. It turns a state snapshot, an
operator objective, and receipt-backed evidence into one safe ops desk packet:
what is happening, what needs attention, what can be checked read-only, what
requires approval, which governed lane should execute, and how success will be
verified.

It is not the authority and it is not a second CLI. It does not replace
`release`, `send-as`, `ledger`, `refund`, `spend`, `messageboard`,
provider-specific adapter skills, hosted API routes, repository workflows, or
deploy commands. It routes to the existing interface with the smallest
sufficient context and stops before any consequential act that lacks the right
gate.

## What this skill does

`ops-desk` produces an ops desk packet for a manager dashboard, agent
session, or self-operation run. It reads projected state, classifies findings,
ranks the next action, selects the governed lane, names blockers, writes the
approval prompt when a human decision is required, and states the
receipt/effect/readback that will prove success.

It is useful before an action and after an action:

- before action, it turns state into proposals and approval requests;
- after action, it checks whether the expected receipt and projection appeared.

The model may diagnose and write the operator rationale. The mutation itself
must be a deterministic handoff to an existing skill runner, CLI command, hosted
API route, workflow, or provider tool.

When the desk should start from durable state, use `operate_from_projection`.
That runner reads a projection through `data-store` first, then passes the
projection as the dashboard snapshot. The storage provider is still selected by
the logical `data_source_ref`; ops desk does not know whether state came from
SQLite, Postgres, D1, Redis, or a product API.

When a standing case must be advanced one move at a time toward a mandate, use
`advance`. It takes the mandate, the current `case_state`, and a fixed
`candidate_roster`, and returns a single typed `dispatch_decision`: dispatch one
roster member, escalate, or done. It applies the same ranking and the same gates as
`operate`, but it is hard-constrained to the roster and emits one move instead of a
multi-proposal plan. The caller (an agency loop) holds the case and the goal; ops
desk supplies the judgment. The chosen member is named as data; ops desk never runs
it.

## When to use this skill

- An operator asks an agent to manage a project, workspace, product, account,
  or other bounded operating surface.
- A dashboard needs an agent-readable plan from the current projected state.
- A runbook needs to decide between read-only checks, proposals, approval-gated
  actions, and post-action verification.
- A product-specific operator skill needs a generic cockpit spine instead of
  inventing its own action model.
- A standing case (an agency) needs the single next governed move chosen from a
  fixed roster, one turn at a time.
- Runx needs to dogfood its own release, registry, hosted, receipt, or provider
  operations through the same governed lanes it exposes to users.

## When not to use this skill

- To execute a live mutation directly. Route to the named governed lane.
- To duplicate a CLI command, release script, GitHub workflow, hosted endpoint,
  registry client, or provider SDK.
- To bypass a human gate because the agent or UI believes the action is obvious.
- To replace a domain skill such as `send-as`, `messageboard`, `release`,
  `ledger`, `refund`, `spend`, `least-privilege`, or a provider
  adapter.
- To operate from stale, missing, or unverifiable state while claiming readiness.
- To put secrets, private keys, raw customer lists, or provider dumps into the
  ops desk packet.

## Operating Model

Use one loop:

```text
snapshot -> findings -> proposals -> approval -> governed lane -> receipt -> projection
```

The manager dashboard and the agent must read the same state and emit the same
action families. A button click and an agent plan are different interfaces over
the same governed lane, not separate backdoors.

## Delegation Model

Ops desk packets name existing execution surfaces; they do not implement them.

- `release` owns release preparation, approval, publish handoff, and
  post-release verification.
- `ledger`, `audit-receipt`, and `run-history` own proof questions.
- `send-as` owns authority for live communications; provider adapter skills own
  provider-specific execution details.
- `spend`, `charge`, `refund`, and branded payment skills own money movement.
- Project skills own product vocabulary and product-specific actions.
- CLI commands, hosted API routes, and GitHub workflows remain deterministic
  execution interfaces. The operator skill may cite them as handoff targets but
  must not clone their behavior in prose.

If no existing lane can perform the action cleanly, return `needs_input` or a
product gap. Do not invent a private workaround.

## Procedure

1. Scope the objective.
   - Identify the workspace, project, account, surface, time window, and whether the ask is
     read-only, proposal-only, or execution-prep.
   - Read `project_profile` or `operator_policy` as context, not authority.
   - If the operating scope or objective is ambiguous, return `needs_input`.

2. Classify state from evidence.
   - Use `dashboard_snapshot`, `receipt_summary`, `effect_summary`, and
     `provider_status` when present.
   - Treat missing evidence as missing. Do not infer success from UI state alone.
   - Separate health, money, communications, provider mutations, access,
     deployment, and incident signals.
   - For review, catalog, publication, bounty, or marketplace work, classify
     whether the artifact is real, useful, complete, and valuable. A reachable
     artifact with no credible user, maintainer, operator, public proof, or
     marketing value is not ready.
   - If using `operate_from_projection`, treat the read projection as the
     dashboard snapshot. An empty projection is not an error, but it should
     usually produce `needs_input` rather than fake readiness.

3. Route to governed lanes.
   - Release questions route to `release` plus the project release profile and
     existing release workflow/commands.
   - Audit questions route to `ledger`, `audit-receipt`, `run-history`,
     or `least-privilege`.
   - Live communication routes through `send-as` and then a provider adapter.
   - Payment collection, payout, refund, chargeback, or target changes route to
     the matching payment lane.
   - Board, thread, and provider actions route to `messageboard`, a provider
     adapter, `issue-intake`, `issue-to-pr`, or the product's own skill.
   - Deploy and config changes route to the product-owned deploy lane.

4. Decide gates.
   - Read-only checks: no human approval.
   - Drafts, dry-runs, previews, and reports: no live-action approval unless they
     expose private data or broaden authority.
   - Live sends, payouts, refunds, customer-visible posts, provider mutations,
     target changes, credential changes, deploys, destructive actions, and broad
     audience decisions: explicit approval required.
   - A review verdict, recommendation, or green dry-run is not payment approval.
     Money movement needs a separate approval prompt naming the amount, recipient,
     rail, target class, and verification receipt expected after settlement.
   - Missing approval means `awaiting_approval`, not "ready".

5. Produce the ops desk packet.
   - Lead with the few issues an operator should act on now.
   - Name the exact lane for each proposed action.
   - Include the existing execution interface as a handoff, not as a duplicated
     implementation.
   - Include approval copy only when the operator could approve it safely.
   - Include verification steps that will prove the action happened.

6. Stop cleanly.
   - Return `needs_input` for missing scope, objective, identity, authority,
     evidence, approval, or target.
   - Return `refused` for requests to bypass gates, hide material facts, leak
     secrets, spoof receipts, mark unsettled money as settled, or send without a
     principal/audience/content digest.

## Edge cases and stop conditions

- **No project/workspace/account or objective:** return `needs_input`; there is
  no safe operating frame.
- **No projection or receipt evidence:** return `needs_input` or `unknown`
  status; do not convert silence into `ok`.
- **Requested action has unknown consequence:** stop at `needs_input` with the
  missing lane/consequence classification.
- **Money, public send, deploy, credential, target, destructive, or provider
  mutation without approval:** return `awaiting_approval`.
- **Approval text is too broad to approve safely:** return `needs_input` with the
  exact missing amount, audience, target, network, provider, or effect.
- **User asks to skip a gate, hide a blocker, forge a receipt, or mark state
  settled without proof:** return `refused`.

## Decision rules

- Prefer one clear next action over a dashboard dump.
- Never bury a required approval in prose; put it in `approval_prompt`.
- Never expose tokens, API keys, raw customer lists, private wallet keys, or
  provider response dumps.
- Never claim a state is settled, sent, deployed, paid, or refunded without a
  receipt/effect/readback reference.
- Never route a public artifact, skill, bounty result, or docs deployment as
  ready when it lacks a credible real-world audience or durable public evidence.
- Never widen authority because a dashboard widget would be convenient.
- Never duplicate an existing CLI command, workflow, hosted endpoint, or domain
  skill in operator prose. Route to it.
- Keep product-specific policy in product context. Keep this skill generic.

## Inputs

- `objective` (required): operator request, e.g. "check payments and unblock
  funding", "prepare a campaign send", or "review stuck receipts".
- `scope_ref` (required): the project, workspace, account, product, or bounded
  surface being operated.
- `dashboard_snapshot` (optional): JSON summary of current projected state.
- `receipt_summary` (optional): JSON or prose receipt/effect summary.
- `provider_status` (optional): JSON or prose provider health/account state.
- `approval_context` (optional): existing operator approvals, denials, or
  policy gates.
- `operator_policy` (optional): project-specific constraints and lane names.
- `project_profile` (optional): project topology, existing interfaces, and
  verification expectations. It is context, not authority.
- `requested_action` (optional): preselected action lane or dashboard action id.

## Worked example

Input: "Check payment readiness and tell me what to do next" with a dashboard
snapshot showing healthy quote/readback state, three funded items, no unfunded
approved items, and one rail adapter webhook status `needs_review`.

Output: `decision: ready`, money status `ok`, providers status
`needs_attention`, one warning finding for rail webhook readiness, and one
proposal routing to `provider.webhook_check` with no money movement. It does
not propose marking anything funded, because no unfunded approved item is
present and the latest funding receipt is already verified.
