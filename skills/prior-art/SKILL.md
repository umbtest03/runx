# Prior Art

Research existing tools, standards, protocols, and skill patterns relevant to
a proposed runx skill or execution flow. Produce verified findings that
constrain the design — not a survey, not a summary, but specific claims with
sources that the skill author needs to make decisions.

Priority order:

1. **Existing tools and CLIs.** If the skill wraps a tool, document the exact
   invocation surface: command name, required arguments, flags, environment
   variables, exit codes, stdout format. Read the tool's source or docs to
   verify — do not describe features from memory.

2. **Protocols and standards.** If the skill interacts with a protocol (MCP,
   A2A, OpenAPI), document the exact message shapes, mandatory fields, and
   version. Read the spec.

3. **Prior art in runx.** Check `skills/` and the registry. Could an existing
   skill be composed or extended instead of building from scratch?

   When `decomposition.required_skills` contains entries where `exists: true`,
   recommending reuse is a first-class output. Do not draft new primitives
   for work an existing skill already covers. Cite the existing skill by
   path in `recommended_flow` and `findings`, and scope any new design work
   to the composition glue around it rather than duplicating its internals.

   Be concrete about catalog fit. Name the adjacent current skill or chain,
   explain the boundary it already owns, and say exactly what remains unsolved.
   "Not quite right" is not enough. The proposal should either clearly reuse
   the current catalog or clearly explain the gap.

4. **Governance patterns.** What scopes does this skill need? Where are the
   mutation boundaries? What approval or review checkpoints does the domain
   imply?

5. **Failure modes.** What goes wrong? Common error conditions, edge cases,
   partial-success scenarios, timeouts, missing context.

For each finding: state the claim, cite where you verified it, and note
whether it constrains the design or just confirms the current direction.
Mark confidence: `verified` (read the source), `likely` (docs or strong
inference), or `unverified` (could not confirm). If you could not verify
something, say so.

## Output

- `findings`: array of claims with `claim`, `source`, `relevance`, `confidence`.
- `recommended_flow`: suggested skill/execution flow based on findings.
- `catalog_fit`: concise explanation of which current runx skills or chains
  were considered, where they stop, and why the proposed skill is new work
  rather than duplication.
- `sources`: references consulted (file paths, URLs, spec names, versions).
- `risks`: adoption, safety, or implementation risks with likelihood,
  impact, and mitigation.

## Inputs

- `objective` (required): the skill objective being researched.
- `decomposition` (optional): output from `work-plan`. When
  provided, focus on validating the proposed steps rather than surveying.
