# scafld

Use this skill when runx needs to govern an existing scafld lifecycle command.

The skill does not replace scafld. It calls the scafld CLI (v1.4.0) with
explicit argv, records the runx receipt for the hop, and lets the chain define
which command is allowed at each step.

## Lifecycle

scafld manages code-change work through a linear lifecycle:

```
draft → approved → in_progress → completed/failed/cancelled
```

Each status maps to a directory under `.ai/specs/`:
- `drafts/` — draft and under_review specs
- `approved/` — approved specs ready to start
- `active/` — in-progress specs being executed
- `archive/YYYY-MM/` — completed, failed, or cancelled specs

The lifecycle commands, in typical order:

1. **`init`** — bootstrap a scafld workspace. Creates the `.ai/` directory
   tree with config, schemas, prompts, and spec directories. Run once per
   repo.

2. **`new <task-id>`** — create a new spec in `drafts/`. The task-id must
   be kebab-case. Flags: `-t` title, `-s` size (micro/small/medium/large),
   `-r` risk (low/medium/high). Creates `.ai/specs/drafts/<task-id>.yaml`
   with TODO placeholders that must be filled before approval.

3. **`validate <task-id>`** — validate the spec against the JSON schema.
   Checks required fields, valid enums, non-empty phases, and that TODO
   placeholders have been replaced. With `--json`, returns structured
   validation result with `valid`, `errors`, and `phase_counts`.

4. **`approve <task-id>`** — validate then move the spec from `drafts/`
   to `approved/`. Sets status to `approved`.

5. **`start <task-id>`** — move the spec from `approved/` to `active/`.
   Sets status to `in_progress`.

6. **`exec <task-id>`** — run acceptance criteria commands from the spec.
   For each criterion with a `command` field, executes the shell command,
   checks the result against `expected`, and records pass/fail back into
   the spec YAML. Flags: `--phase` to run only one phase, `--resume` to
   skip already-passed criteria. Default timeout 600s per criterion,
   overridable with `timeout_seconds` on each criterion.

7. **`audit <task-id>`** — compare declared file changes in the spec
   against actual `git diff`. Reports scope creep (undeclared changes)
   and missing changes (declared but not present). Exits 1 on any
   undeclared files. Flag: `--base` to set git base ref (default HEAD~1).

8. **`review <task-id>`** — open a review round. Runs automated passes
   first (spec_compliance re-runs acceptance criteria, scope_drift runs
   audit). If automated passes fail, exits 1 with instructions to fix.
   On success, creates `.ai/reviews/<task-id>.md` with a Review Artifact
   v3 template and prints the adversarial review prompt. With `--json`,
   returns `review_file`, `review_prompt`, `automated_passes`, and
   `required_sections`. The three adversarial sections (regression_hunt,
   convention_check, dark_patterns) must be filled by a reviewer before
   `complete` can run.

9. **`complete <task-id>`** — finalize the review and archive the spec.
   Validates that the review artifact exists, all adversarial sections
   are filled, verdict is not fail/incomplete, and pass results are
   consistent. On success, writes a `review:` block into the spec and
   moves it to `archive/YYYY-MM/` with status `completed`. On failure,
   exits 1 with the gate reason. With `--json`, returns `completed_state`,
   `archive_path`, `verdict`, `pass_results`. Override path:
   `--human-reviewed --reason "..."` allows completing with an override
   (requires interactive terminal confirmation).

10. **`status <task-id>`** — show spec status, phase progress, review
    state. With `--json`, returns structured status with `phase_counts`
    and `review_state`.

11. **`fail <task-id>`** — move an in-progress spec to archive with
    status `failed`.

12. **`cancel <task-id>`** — move a spec to archive with status
    `cancelled`.

## Review handoff

The `review` command opens the review round and returns the review file
path and adversarial prompt. The actual review is **reviewer-mediated**: the
chain routes it through the caller boundary so the reviewer may be a human,
the controlling agent, or a peer agent. The `agent` runner on this skill
receives `task_id`, `review_file`, and `review_prompt` and must fill the
three adversarial sections in the review artifact before `complete` runs.

After filling, the reviewer must update the review metadata: set
`round_status` to `completed`, set each adversarial pass result to
`pass`/`fail`/`pass_with_issues`, fill blocking/non-blocking findings,
and set the verdict line to `pass`, `fail`, or `pass_with_issues`.

## Spec YAML structure

The spec file (`.ai/specs/.../<task-id>.yaml`) contains:

- `spec_version`: "1.1"
- `task_id`, `status`, `created`, `updated`
- `task`: title, summary, size, risk_level, context (packages, invariants,
  files_impacted, cwd), objectives, touchpoints, acceptance (definition_of_done,
  validation)
- `phases[]`: id (phase1, phase2, ...), name, objective, changes[] (file,
  action, content_spec), acceptance_criteria[] (id, type, description,
  command, expected, cwd, timeout_seconds)
- `rollback`: strategy (per_phase/atomic/manual), commands
- `planning_log`: timestamped entries

## Inputs

- `command` (required): scafld command to run. Accepts: `init`, `new`/`spec`,
  `approve`, `start`, `exec`/`execute`, `audit`, `review`, `complete`,
  `validate`, `status`, `fail`, `cancel`. Aliases: `spec` maps to `new`,
  `execute` maps to `exec`.
- `task_id`: scafld task id (required for all commands except `init`).
- `fixture`: workspace root containing `.ai/`; used as scafld working directory.
- `title`: title for `new` command (`-t` flag).
- `size`: size for `new` command (`-s` flag): micro, small, medium, large.
- `risk`: risk for `new` command (`-r` flag): low, medium, high.
- `phase`: phase for `exec` command (`--phase` flag).
- `scafld_bin`: explicit scafld executable path. Defaults to `SCAFLD_BIN`
  env var or `scafld` on PATH.

## Structured output

Commands `review`, `complete`, `status`, and `validate` are run with
`--json` so chain policy and reviewer-facing steps consume structured
fields, not terminal prose.
