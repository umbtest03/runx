# Ledger

Answer one audit question against the whole receipt ledger, and prove the chain
behind the answer.

runx seals a receipt for every run. Those receipts accumulate into a ledger:
every act, every approval, every refusal, across every principal and every
skill, in sealed order. When an auditor asks "did anyone spend over $500 last
week", "how many sends did this principal authorize", or "which runs touched the
billing scope", the answer lives in that ledger. This skill turns the question
into a ledger query, returns the receipts that match by id, and, when asked,
verifies that the matched stretch of the chain is intact. It reads; it never
writes.

## What this skill does

`ledger` applies an explicit bounded query over receipt ids, principal, skill
ref, status, and time range, then returns the receipts that satisfy it as
id-keyed stubs (`receipt_id`, `skill_ref`, `status`, `created_at`, verification
status), never a
receipt body. When `proof` asks for it, the skill confirms the matched stretch of
the chain is intact, naming any break by the receipt ids involved. The chain is
the proof; a count that looks plausible is not. The skill answers the question in
one or two sentences grounded only in the matched set and the verification
result, and stops with `needs_more_evidence` when the ledger is silent rather
than reporting a fabricated zero.

The default `read` runner is a read-only front to the shipped receipt engine. It
shells `runx history --json` to list matched receipts from the
sandbox's own receipt store (rooted at `RUNX_RECEIPT_DIR`) and, when `proof` is
requested, `runx verify --json` for each matched receipt's tree verdict. It is
the in-sandbox way for an agent to read its own sealed receipts before a gated
action, with no caller-supplied stubs. It projects to id-stubs only and never returns a
receipt body, act payload, or secret field.

The `read` runner accepts one optional `receipts` input: explicit ledger rows
for replay or controlled evaluation. When present it uses those rows directly
instead of shelling `runx history`, which is how the inline harness seeds a
deterministic ledger without a populated store.

It queries and proves history across many runs; `audit-receipt` audits the
integrity of a single receipt chain. Its nearest neighbor is
`run-history`, which also reads the ledger but returns deterministic platform
outcome and catalog-coverage metrics and routes them to governance
lanes. `ledger` answers one precise audit question with the receipt ids that
match and a verified chain walk, not an aggregate health report.

## When to use this skill

- An auditor needs a cross-run answer: counts, totals-by-reference, who did what,
  which runs touched a scope or skill over a window.
- A review needs the set of receipts that match a condition before drilling into
  any single one.
- A compliance check needs proof that a stretch of ledger history is unbroken.

## When not to use this skill

- To audit whether one run stayed inside its grant. Use `audit-receipt`; that
  is the integrity-of-one-chain question, not the cross-run history question
  `ledger` answers.
- To narrow a grant from observed usage. Use `least-privilege`.
- For a graded platform-health report over many runs. Use `run-history`.
- To mutate, redact, export, or archive receipts. This skill is read-only and
  refuses any write framing.
- To return receipt bodies, act payloads, or any secret-bearing field. Matched
  receipts are id stubs only.

## Procedure

1. Read the question. With no question, return `needs_agent`.
2. Resolve the filter into a bounded query: principal handle, `skill_ref`,
   status set, and `time_range`. An absent filter means the question alone bounds
   the query.
3. Match receipts against the query and collect id-keyed stubs only. Receipt
   bodies, act payloads, proofs, and material refs stay out of the output.
4. With zero matches, return `needs_more_evidence` and name the query that found
   nothing.
5. When `proof` requests chain verification, take the chain verdict from the
   engine's tree-rooted verify report (`runx verify`), not a hand-rolled link
   walk: `intact` follows the report's overall validity, and each `break` is
   derived from a tree's missing parent or a verification finding, named by the
   receipt ids involved. When the engine has no verify keys
   (`RUNX_RECEIPT_VERIFY_KID` / `RUNX_RECEIPT_VERIFY_ED25519_PUBLIC_KEY_BASE64`
   absent), it cannot prove production signatures, so the chain is reported
   unverified (`checked: true`, `intact: null`), never silently intact. When
   `proof` is absent, set `chain_verification.checked` to false and leave
   `intact` null.
6. Write a one or two sentence `summary` that answers the question from the
   matched set and the verification result only. The question bounds the answer;
   do not generalize from the matched slice to the whole ledger.
7. Return the `ledger_answer` with `decision: answered`.

## Edge cases and stop conditions

- **No question:** return `needs_agent`; there is nothing to query.
- **No matching receipts:** return `needs_more_evidence` with the resolved query,
  so the gap is the query, not a silent zero. Silence is a stop, not a zero.
- **Filter references an unknown principal or skill_ref:** treat as zero matches
  and return `needs_more_evidence`; do not guess a near match.
- **Chain break found:** keep `decision: answered` but set
  `chain_verification.intact` false and list the breaking id pairs from the
  verify report; an intact answer set with a broken chain is still a reportable
  result.
- **Verify keys absent:** report `chain_verification.intact` null with
  `checked: true`; the chain is unverified, not intact.
- **Verification requested over an empty match set:** the stop is
  `needs_more_evidence` for the match, not a chain claim over nothing.
- **Write, delete, or reseal framing in the question:** refuse; this skill holds
  `ledger:read` scope only and no gate can widen it.

## Output schema

  query:                  # the resolved filter actually run, so the answer reproduces
    principal: string
    skill_ref: string
    status: array
    time_range:
      from: string
      to: string
matched_receipts:         # id-keyed stubs only; never a receipt body
  - receipt_id: string
    skill_ref: string
    status: string
    created_at: string
chain_verification:
  checked: boolean        # was verification requested
  intact: boolean | null  # null when unchecked

```

The `ledger_answer` object is the named packet `runx.ledger_answer.v1`. Scope is
`ledger:read` only; no gate is required because the skill cannot mutate, and a
delete, redact, reseal, or reorder request is refused, not gated. The run's own
receipt carries the question, the resolved query, the matched count, the list of
matched `receipt_id` values, and the chain-verification result; it carries no
matched receipt body, principal PII, or secret material. Matched receipts are
always referenced by id.

## Worked example

Input: "Which spend runs over $500 sealed for the ops principal last week, and is
that stretch of the chain intact?" with a filter scoping `principal:ops`,
`skill_ref runx/spend`, status `sealed`, and the 2026-06-01 to 2026-06-08
window, plus `proof: { verify_chain: true }`.

Output: `decision: answered`. The resolved query is echoed for reproducibility.
`matched_receipts` lists two sealed spend stubs by id with `skill_ref`, `status`,
and `created_at`, no bodies. `chain_verification` reports `checked: true`,
`intact: true`, `breaks: []` from the engine's tree-rooted verify verdict over
the store. The `summary` reads: two sealed spend runs over $500 ran for
`principal:ops` in the window, and the verify verdict is intact. Had the window
matched zero receipts, the run would stop at `needs_more_evidence` naming the
query, not report a clean zero. Run through the `read` runner, the same answer
comes straight from `runx history`/`runx verify` over the sandbox's own store;
when the verify keys are absent the chain is reported unverified rather than
intact.

## Inputs

- `question` (optional): the audit question bounding the ledger read. Without
  one the runner returns `needs_agent` and does not query.
- `filter` (optional): JSON narrowing the query by `principal`, `skill_ref`,
  `status`, `time_range` (`from`/`to`), and `limit` (default 500, maximum 5000).
- `receipt_ids` (optional): up to 100 exact receipt ids to resolve and verify.
- `proof` (optional): JSON requesting chain verification over the matched
  receipts, for example `{ "verify_chain": true }`.
- `receipts` (optional): explicit ledger rows for replay or
  controlled evaluation; when present the `read` runner uses them instead of
  shelling `runx history`.
