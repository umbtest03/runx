# Release

Turn a proposed release into an audited publication. The skill owns the
changelog, the release checks, the publish, and the announcement — but
splits them across scopes so the destructive work stays behind an explicit
approval.

Two runners:

- **`prepare`** (read-only) — survey the commit range since the last tag,
  classify commits, stage a changelog, run the declared checks, and emit a
  `release_brief` describing what would ship, what is blocked, and what
  remains unresolved. Safe to run unattended and in CI.
- **`release`** (default, graph) — wires `prepare` → approval gate →
  `publish`. `publish` is not exposed as a standalone runner; it is only
  reachable inside the graph after the approval transition clears.

Invoke `runx skill release prepare` for a CI dry-run. Invoke
`runx skill release` to run the governed end-to-end flow.

## Phases

### prepare

The read-only phase. Reads git history, classifies each commit since the
previous semver tag (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `breaking`),
stages a changelog, and runs the declared release checks. Emits a
`release_brief` with the findings.

The brief is the only artifact that flows forward. If it is not
`publishable`, the graph stops at the approval gate with the reasons
attached.

### approve-publish

A typed approval step. The gate id is `release.publish.approval`. The
brief is provided as context so the approver sees what would ship before
deciding.

The policy transition only advances to `publish-release` when
`approve-publish.approval_decision.data.approved` is `true`. No back
channel, no implicit approval on timeout.

### publish-release

The destructive phase. Takes the approved `release_brief` from graph
context and carries out the declared publication — tag and push, upload
to the registry, open the release artifact, emit the announcement packet.
Every side effect is recorded in `publish_report.side_effects[]` with a
receipt link.

Refuses to act if the brief is missing, unpublishable, or not carried
through the approval gate.

## Quality Profile

- Purpose: turn release evidence into an audited publish/no-publish decision
  and, after approval, a versioned release.
- Audience: maintainers, package consumers, and operators reviewing the release
  trail.
- Artifact contract: release brief, changelog, check results, unresolved flags,
  approval decision, publish report, and announcement packet.
- Evidence bar: changelog and version claims must trace to commits, tags,
  checks, package metadata, or explicit operator context.
- Voice bar: release writing should be concrete and user-facing. Do not pad
  with generic launch language or hide blockers behind positive wording.
- Strategic bar: the release should explain why this version matters and what
  users should do next.
- Stop conditions: stop at prepare or approval when checks fail, versioning is
  unclear, changelog evidence is thin, or the announcement would overstate the
  release.

## Inputs

| Name | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `project_root` | yes | Absolute path to the project being released. |
| `channel` | yes | Publishing target (`npm`, `pypi`, `github-release`). |
| `last_tag` | no | Previous release anchor. Defaults to the latest semver tag reachable from the current branch. |
| `operator_context` | no | Cadence, campaign, or posture guidance for this release. |

## Outputs

- `prepare` emits `release_brief_packet` carrying `release_brief`:
  changelog, check results, proposed version, unresolved flags,
  publishable verdict.
- The graph emits a graph receipt that links the prepare brief, the
  approval decision, and the publish report into one auditable trail.
- `publish-release` (inside the graph) emits `publish_report`: registry
  URL, release tag, announcement packet, and a `side_effects[]` list with
  a receipt per write action.

## Trust boundary

`prepare` is safe to run unattended and in CI. The destructive work is
only reachable through the graph, and the graph refuses to transition to
`publish-release` without an approved decision from
`release.publish.approval`. The graph enforces the gate; the skill does
not bypass it.

## Scopes

- `runx:release:read` — required by the prepare phase.
- `runx:release:publish` — required by the publish phase; the graph grant
  must include this only when the approval transition has cleared.

## Tasks

- `release-prepare` — the read-only phase task. Provides the
  `release_brief` output shape.
- `release-publish` — the destructive phase task. Only reachable inside
  the graph; requires the approved brief in context.

These are agent-step task contracts carried by the skill package and its
`X.yaml` graph definition. They are not a separate registered task catalog.
