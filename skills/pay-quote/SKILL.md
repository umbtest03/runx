# Pay Quote

Turn a payment-required signal into a decision-ready quote packet.

This skill is the read side of agent payments. It normalizes the challenge,
identifies the requested rail, amount, counterparty, realm, operation, and
idempotency seed, then proposes the narrowest payment authority bounds that
could satisfy the request.

It does not authorize spend, reserve budget, call a rail, or receive funding
credentials. Its output is evidence for a later Decision, not a payment.

## Quality Profile

- Purpose: make a paid tool request legible enough for runx core to decide
  whether payment authority can be admitted.
- Audience: the parent harness, approval gate, operator, and downstream rail
  skill.
- Artifact contract: `payment_quote`, `requested_payment_authority`,
  `challenge_evidence`, `risk_notes`, and `open_questions`.
- Evidence bar: every amount, counterparty, operation, rail, and expiration
  must come from the challenge, supplied operator intent, or a named inference.
- Voice bar: concise payment-operations prose. Do not explain payment protocols
  generically.
- Strategic bar: preserve the smallest authority shape that could work; do not
  widen rails, realms, or caps for convenience.
- Stop conditions: return `needs_agent` when currency, amount, counterparty,
  operation, rail, or idempotency material is missing.

## Output

- `payment_quote`: normalized quote with amount in minor units, currency, rail
  candidates, counterparty, operation, quote expiry, and source refs.
- `requested_payment_authority`: requested `payment` authority bounds for the
  later reservation decision.
- `challenge_evidence`: source refs and redacted challenge details.
- `risk_notes`: policy, fraud, replay, or ambiguity notes.
- `open_questions`: missing data that blocks reservation.

## Inputs

- `payment_signal` (required): payment-required signal, MCP challenge, invoice,
  checkout request, or operator intent.
- `realm` (optional): authority realm such as `local`, `test`, or `prod`.
- `rail_preferences` (optional): ordered rail preference list.
- `max_per_call_minor` (optional): caller cap in minor currency units.
- `currency` (optional): caller-expected ISO 4217 currency.
- `operation` (optional): stable operation name for the paid action.
- `counterparty` (optional): expected merchant or payee reference.
- `idempotency_seed` (optional): stable caller-provided idempotency material.
