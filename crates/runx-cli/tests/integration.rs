//! Single integration-test binary for runx-cli.
//!
//! Each module below is one integration test file, compiled and linked once
//! as a single binary instead of one binary per file. `support` is the shared
//! helper module (tests/support/), referenced by test modules as
//! `crate::support`. `autotests = false` in Cargo.toml keeps Cargo from also
//! building each file as its own binary.
//! See .scafld/specs/drafts/test-surface-build-consolidation.md.
