#![cfg(feature = "cli-tool")]
//! Conformance for the uniform-governance seal invariant.
//!
//! Every registered graph step is admitted centrally and its admission witness is
//! sealed in one central place (`run_registered_step`). So an admitted step records
//! which authority admitted the act, and an unadmitted step falls back to a
//! local-runtime witness rather than fabricating one. Because the seal is central
//! and step-type-agnostic, exercising one real graph proves the invariant for every
//! step type, so this is two focused end-to-end checks rather than one per type.
