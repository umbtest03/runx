# runx security hardening v1

## Current State

Status: review
Current phase: omnibus complete; remaining findings split into narrow specs
Next: review this omnibus for the completed mechanism work, then execute the
new focused follow-up specs for the remaining trust-boundary gaps.
Reason: C1/C2/C4/C5/C6/C7/R1/R2/R3/R4/R7/R9/R10/R11/R12 are implemented for
their current live boundaries. The remaining real issues are no longer a single
omnibus execution unit: R5 is the skill-asserted output versus
supervisor-attested facts boundary; R8 is registry publisher trust anchoring;
R13 is process credential delivery for MCP/external/outbox. These are now
tracked as fresh narrow specs so this broad hardening ledger stops blocking
unrelated Rust work.
Blockers: formal review remains for this omnibus status. Follow-up blockers are
owned by `skill-output-attestation-boundary-v1`,
`registry-signed-manifest-trust-anchor-v1`, and
`process-credential-delivery-hardening-v1`.

## Summary

Harden runx's security posture before any untrusted-skill execution or
production-payment story. The architecture is sound (capability/authority model,
receipt-centric design, pure policy kernel), but several controls are currently
*declarations or placeholders* rather than *enforced mechanisms*: the sandbox
does not confine, the receipt seal does not cryptographically bind, the payment
proof is skill-asserted, and a few core admission edges fail open. This spec
ranks the findings by severity and sequences them surgical-first.

This is a defensive-security spec. No finding here authorizes adding
provider/integration code to the kernel; the trust boundaries from
`external-adapter-plugin-protocol-v1`, `skill-author-runtime-contract-v1`, and
`canonical-json-fingerprint-contract-v1` still hold and are referenced where a
finding overlaps them.

## Context

The exposures cluster on three trust-boundary assumptions that do not yet hold:
the sandbox confines (it does not), the seal attests (it is a placeholder), and
the payment proof proves (it is asserted). Plus a set of narrower core-admission
and runtime edges. Findings are grounded in file:line.

Severity legend: **Critical** = breaks a core security claim; **High** =
exploitable bypass or secret exposure; **Medium** = hardening / defense-in-depth.

## Core findings (`runx-core`)

- **C1 [Critical, fail-open] — DONE (core OSS).** `find_matching_grant`
  (`policy/connected_auth.rs`) admitted any grant whose `status != Some(Revoked)`,
  so a grant with `status: None` (the field is `skip_serializing_if`, so omitted
  JSON deserializes to `None`) was admitted. Fixed to require `Some(Active)`
  (fail-closed on missing status). Added `not_before` / `expires_at` to
  `LocalAdmissionGrant`, explicit `connected_auth_checked_at` inputs for the
  pure policy evaluators, and fail-closed lifetime checks: active grants now deny
  if they are unbounded, malformed, expired, not yet valid, or evaluated without
  a timestamp. The current MIT OSS branch has no active `HttpConnectGrant`
  runtime type after the connect brokerage removal; private/hosted connect
  schemas still need parity if reintroduced.
- **C2 [Medium-High, audit integrity] — DONE (subset-proof gate).** The kernel
  recomputes `is_payment_authority_subset(child, parent)` (sound, correct
  direction), and the runtime now passes the typed `AuthoritySubsetProof` into
  `StepAuthorityAdmission`. Payment attenuation rejects missing or mismatched
  subset proofs by parent ref, compared child/parent term ids, relation, result,
  algorithm, and checked timestamp. This closes the caller-supplied boolean
  proof-presence gap. The remaining R3 rail-settlement proof issue stays open.
- **C3 [Medium, coverage] — deep attenuation is payment-only.**
  `admit_step_authority` runs the bounds/capability/condition subset algebra only
  for `resource_family == Payment && spends`; all other families return
  `verb: None` with no attenuation and rely solely on `scope_allows` prefix
  matching. → confirm intentional or extend attenuation to other high-value
  resource families (deploy, repo-write).
- **C4 [Medium] — DONE (aggregate spend capped).** `minor_unit_caps_subset`
  (`policy/payment_authority.rs`) now requires at least one aggregate cap
  (`max_per_run_minor` or `max_per_period_minor`) on both parent and child spend
  authority before per-call caps can pass subset comparison. The policy fixture
  `payment-authority-denies-unbounded-aggregate-spend` covers the fail-closed
  path.
- **C5 [Medium] — DONE (untrusted wildcard denied; prefix narrowed).**
  `scope_allows` now gates universal `*` behind an explicit trusted-callsite
  flag. Graph scope propagation can still use first-party `*`, but connected
  auth / credential grants fail closed on universal wildcard input. Prefix
  wildcards are single-segment: `repo:*` admits `repo:read` and denies
  `repo:admin:keys`. Added kernel parity fixtures and TS/Rust policy coverage for
  both edges.
- **C6 [Medium, design] — DONE (success requires admission witness).** The pure
  single-step and sequential graph state machines now require a
  `StepAdmissionWitness` on success transitions. Sequential success also checks
  that the witness step id and receipt id match the step being sealed, so a
  runner cannot transition a step to succeeded through the kernel without an
  admission/receipt witness.
- **C7 [Medium] — DONE (input limits).** `kernel_eval.rs` now fails closed before
  dispatch on oversized kernel-eval documents and structurally excessive JSON:
  max document bytes, JSON depth, node count, array length, object field count,
  object key bytes, and string bytes. Added fail-closed tests for oversized,
  deeply nested, and wide documents. Fuzzing remains a follow-up hardening item.

## Runtime findings (`runx-runtime`)

- **R1 [Critical] — DONE (backend-gated sandbox enforcement, harden pending).**
  `sandbox.rs` resolves a local enforcement runtime, wraps process execution
  with bubblewrap on Linux or sandbox-exec on macOS when available, fails closed
  when `require_enforcement` or `RUNX_SANDBOX_REQUIRE_ENFORCEMENT` is set and no
  backend can enforce, and emits runtime/filesystem/network metadata such as
  `bubblewrap-mount-namespace`, `sandbox-exec-seatbelt`, or
  `not-enforced-local`. `cli_tool_contract.rs` includes a backend-gated readonly
  write-denial regression. Full harden/review and platform validation remain
  pending.
- **R2 [Critical] — DONE (production signing path wired, harden pending).**
  Runtime receipt creation now resolves `RuntimeReceiptSignatureConfig` from
  `RUNX_RECEIPT_SIGN_*` env, uses Ed25519 production signing when configured,
  rejects incomplete production signing env, verifies production signatures with
  configured public keys, and routes step/graph/single-skill/MCP receipt writes
  through the active policy. Local development pseudo-signing remains explicit.
- **R3 [Critical] — DONE (runtime supervisor boundary, harden pending).**
  Payment spend success now requires `RuntimePaymentSupervisor` settlement
  evidence before a success receipt can stand. The default supervisor rejects,
  so a skill-produced `Verification`+`PaymentRail` reference is denied unless a
  configured supervisor returns matching settlement evidence bound to admitted
  rail, counterparty, amount, currency, idempotency key, spend capability, act,
  receipt ref, and receipt digest. Focused payment tests cover the no-supervisor
  and proofless-rail failures.
- **R4 [High] — DONE for `cli-tool`; residual split to R13.**
  `CliToolAdapter` rejects process-env credential delivery before spawning.
  Residual env-based delivery for MCP, external adapters, and outbox providers
  is the cross-cutting R13 credential-delivery follow-up.
- **R5 [High] — skill stdout trusted as structured output.** stdout-as-JSON →
  `outputs` feeds receipts and authority fields; attacker-controlled. → separate
  skill-asserted output from supervisor-attested facts.
- **R6 [High] — canonical-JSON byte-identity unpinned across runtimes.** 4
  independent canonicalizers stamp `runx.stable-json.v1`; `canonical_json_number`
  = `JsonNumber::to_string()` (float/precision divergence). Digest confusion.
  Owned by `canonical-json-fingerprint-contract-v1` — cross-reference, do not
  duplicate.
- **R7 [High, payments] — DONE (file lock + reload before mutation).**
  `FileBackedPaymentStateStore` now takes a sidecar lock for state mutations,
  reloads the current persisted document under the lock before applying the
  mutation, and writes through the locked state. `payment_state` regression tests
  cover stale stores refusing to overwrite already-recorded idempotency state.
- **R8 [High, supply chain] — split to focused spec.**
  `registry/install.rs::validate_candidate_digest` hashes the candidate's own
  markdown against a digest the candidate supplies → no trust anchor (with R2, no
  root of trust beyond the `TrustTier` label). Follow-up:
  `registry-signed-manifest-trust-anchor-v1`.
- **R9 [Medium] — DONE.** `RUNX_INPUT_*` env-name collisions fail closed.
- **R10 [Medium] — DONE for current live HTTP surfaces.** Runtime HTTP rejects
  localhost/RFC1918/link-local/metadata hosts and disables redirects. External
  adapter and outbox HTTP transport are currently rejected; A2A has no live HTTP
  implementation. Future live A2A HTTP should get its own egress spec.
- **R11 [Medium] — DONE on Unix process paths.** `cli-tool`, external adapter,
  and outbox provider create process groups and kill negative PGIDs on timeout.
  Windows/job-object parity remains a future platform spec if Windows enters
  support scope.
- **R12 [Medium] — DONE for live runtime defaults.** `RuntimeOptions::default()`
  stamps trusted live time, and deterministic harness/parity paths explicitly
  pin fixture time. Optional API hardening may later make caller-supplied
  timestamps unrepresentable.
- **R13 [Medium] — split to focused spec.** External adapter and outbox process
  credential delivery still need a non-env or strictly constrained channel.
  Follow-up: `process-credential-delivery-hardening-v1`.

## Risks

- Fail-closed changes (C1/C4/C5) can deny previously-admitted edges; gate each on
  fixture review so a security tightening does not silently break a legitimate
  flow.
- R1/R2 are platform- and key-management-heavy; scope per-OS and per-environment.
- Several items touch files under active parallel work (payment, target_runner,
  contract spine); sequence around those workstreams.

## Acceptance

- [x] `dod1` C1 fail-closed on missing grant status, tests green.

## Rollback

Phase 1 fixes are independent and individually revertible. Phases 2–4 are
additive enforcement; nothing here changes wire shapes except the grant
expiry/proof-verification additions, which are gated on the schema-validation
work.

## Origin

User-directed pentest review on 2026-05-21/22: widen findings into the Rust core
(which must be S-tier) and capture all findings into a work spec. Core attenuation
algebra verified largely sound; exposures are at admission edges, enforcement
placeholders, and skill-asserted trust.
