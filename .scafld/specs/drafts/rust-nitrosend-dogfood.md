# Rust nitrosend dogfood

## Current State

Status: draft
Current phase: actual Nitrosend dogfood wrapper consumes the Rust contract;
external replay pending
Next: add Rust runtime replay only after target execution and observer runtime
gates are ready
Reason: refreshed against the current local OSS checkout and the actual
Nitrosend repo. Nitrosend now uses `runx.operational_policy.v1` for its
repo-local issue-intake policy and the Rust harness receipt contract in its
dogfood fixtures.
Blockers: `runx-target-repo-runners` and
`runx-post-merge-closure-observer` are still draft for live external replay.
A sanitized external-shaped fixture contract exists and Nitrosend local wrapper
fixtures replay through the Rust binary, but no live target-runner/observer
external replay has been added.
Allowed follow-up command: none during this refresh; do not run
`scafld harden rust-nitrosend-dogfood`.
Latest runner update: 2026-05-21 closed the Segment dogfood evidence gap:
`segment-from-prose` now rejects non-`runx.harness_receipt.v1` evidence and
returns the sealed `receipt_id` to callers. 2026-05-20 added Rust contract
request-admission coverage for the Nitrosend-like policy. The Rust API admits
`nitrosend/nitrosend`, `nitrosend/api`, and `nitrosend/app` through the
policy-backed source, target, runner, owner, dedupe, and closure/proof surface,
and denies unknown target repos and missing source-thread routing before
mutation.
Runtime skill fixtures are present; `fixtures/external/nitrosend/issue-intake`
now contains the sanitized `api-source-thread.json` fixture; the Nitrosend-like
policy fixture covers workspace, API, and app target routing; contract policy
validation passed; after refreshing ignored `dist` output with `pnpm build`,
CLI policy lint/inspect also pass.
Review gate: not_started

## Summary

Use Nitrosend as the external-shaped dogfood for the Rust runtime cutover, but
keep the plan honest about what exists in this OSS checkout today.

Current local facts:

- Generic runtime fixtures exist for the upstream `issue-intake` and
  `issue-to-pr` skills under `fixtures/runtime/skills/issue-intake/` and
  `fixtures/runtime/skills/issue-to-pr/`.
- A reusable operational policy contract exists as
  `runx.operational_policy.v1`, with CLI support in
  `packages/cli/src/commands/policy.ts` and schemas/fixtures under
  `schemas/operational-policy.schema.json` and `fixtures/operational-policy/`.
- `fixtures/operational-policy/nitrosend-like.json` is present, but it is only
  Nitrosend-like. It now includes `nitrosend/nitrosend`, `nitrosend/api`, and
  `nitrosend/app` so policy lint/inspect cover the real target set.
- `fixtures/external/nitrosend/issue-intake/api-source-thread.json` exists as
  the first sanitized external-shaped fixture contract. It cites the generic
  runtime fixtures, the Nitrosend-like policy, the target-runner planning and
  dedupe lookup contracts, and the post-merge harness receipt fixture.
- The current reusable follow-on work is not complete: target-repo runner
  live execution and the post-merge closure observer runtime are both draft
  specs.

The dogfood goal is preservation, not a new adopter flow. The real Nitrosend
workflow may keep using the human/product names `issue-intake` and
`issue-to-pr`, but cutover execution artifacts must be canonical harness,
decision, act, proof, and sealed `runx.harness_receipt.v1` objects only.

This spec must not invent live Nitrosend traffic capture. Initial validation is
fixture parity against checked-in, sanitized, deterministic external-shaped
fixtures. Production soak is a later confirmation step after fixture, policy,
target-runner, and post-merge observer gates are green.

## Context

CWD: `.` (runx OSS workspace)

Relevant existing local surfaces:

- `skills/issue-intake/SKILL.md`
- `skills/issue-intake/X.yaml`
- `skills/issue-to-pr/SKILL.md`
- `skills/issue-to-pr/X.yaml`
- `fixtures/runtime/skills/issue-intake/cases/*.yaml`
- `fixtures/runtime/skills/issue-to-pr/cases/*.yaml`
- `fixtures/operational-policy/nitrosend-like.json`
- `packages/contracts/src/schemas/operational-policy.ts`
- `schemas/operational-policy.schema.json`
- `packages/cli/src/commands/policy.ts`
- `.scafld/specs/drafts/runx-target-repo-runners.md`
- `.scafld/specs/drafts/runx-post-merge-closure-observer.md`

Missing local surfaces this plan must create or wait for:

- `fixtures/external/nitrosend/issue-intake/**`
- `crates/runx-runtime/tests/external/nitrosend_issue_intake.rs`
- Target PR creation through the reusable target-repo runner contract.
- Post-merge/provider observation through sealed closure/proof receipts.

## Invariants

- No compatibility reader or writer translates retired outcome/effect/report
  artifacts into harness receipts at runtime.
- Product copy, skill names, slash-command text, and source-thread comments may
  say `issue-intake` or `issue-to-pr`; persisted execution contract ids,
  fixture artifact kinds, outbox contract payload ids, and Rust structs must not
  use those names as legacy execution artifact identifiers.
- External fixtures are deterministic and sanitized. They are not captured live
  during CI, and they do not depend on private Nitrosend repositories being
  checked out.
- `runx.operational_policy.v1` is the policy boundary. Nitrosend-specific JSON
  can be an input to a one-time conversion, but core runtime behavior must not
  dual-read adopter policy formats.
- Missing source-thread metadata fails closed before any Slack/GitHub final
  publication.
- Target completion, failed verification, source issue closure, and final
  source-thread replies are modeled through contained act closure plus
  proof-bound verification on sealed harness receipts.

## Objectives

- Add an external-shaped Nitrosend fixture suite that layers the existing
  generic `issue-intake`/`issue-to-pr` runtime fixtures into a realistic
  multi-target policy scenario.
- Extend the Nitrosend-like operational policy fixture to include
  `nitrosend/api` and prove workspace, API, and app target routing.
- Validate `runx policy lint` and `runx policy inspect` against the
  Nitrosend-like policy without leaking raw provider locators.
- Coordinate with `runx-target-repo-runners` so target PR creation, dedupe, and
  source-thread metadata are reusable core behavior.
- Coordinate with `runx-post-merge-closure-observer` so merge/close/deploy
  observation, final publication, and source issue closure are sealed
  closure/proof receipts, not a Nitrosend-only observer path.
- Add Rust runtime replay coverage only after the external-shaped fixture and
  the reusable runner/observer contracts exist.

## Scope

In scope:

- Plan and fixture contract for Nitrosend-shaped issue intake.
- Policy fixture coverage for `nitrosend/api`.
- Runtime parity expectations for canonical harness receipts.
- Explicit dependency on target-repo runner and post-merge closure observer
  work.

Out of scope:

- Editing Nitrosend production repositories.
- Live external traffic capture.
- Scafld hardening in this refresh.
- Compatibility with retired peer terminal artifacts, including legacy
  outcome/effect packets and report-shaped verification payloads.

## Dependencies

- `runx-contract-spine-hard-cutover` for canonical harness, decision, act,
  proof, and receipt shapes.
- `rust-runtime-skeleton` and `rust-runtime-skill-execution`.
- `rust-receipt-proof-verification`, `rust-receipt-tree-resolution`, and
  `rust-runtime-receipt-path-discovery`.
- `runx-operational-policy-config` as the completed policy contract.
- `runx-target-repo-runners` before target dispatch parity can pass.
- `runx-post-merge-closure-observer` before final closure/proof parity can
  pass.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Existing generic `issue-intake` and `issue-to-pr` runtime fixtures remain
  green and are referenced by the external-shaped Nitrosend fixture plan.
- [x] `fixtures/external/nitrosend/issue-intake/**` exists and contains
  sanitized deterministic inputs, not live external capture.
- [x] The Nitrosend-like operational policy fixture covers
  `nitrosend/nitrosend`, `nitrosend/api`, and `nitrosend/app`.
- [x] `runx policy lint fixtures/operational-policy/nitrosend-like.json`
  accepts the policy, and `runx policy inspect` redacts raw provider locators.
- [ ] Target PR creation uses `runx-target-repo-runners`; dedupe is represented
  in pull-request outbox `metadata.dedupe` and in the sealed receipt proof path.
- [ ] Target completion and final publication use
  `runx-post-merge-closure-observer` only through closure/proof on sealed
  harness receipts.
- [ ] No fixture, schema id, persisted receipt, or replay expectation uses
  retired peer terminal artifacts, legacy outcome/effect packet fields, or
  report-shaped verification payloads; completion is represented as harness
  receipt closure with `proof.verification`.
- [ ] Replaying the same external-shaped fixture twice produces identical
  canonical receipt bytes after normalized fixture ids/timestamps and passes
  proof verification.

```

2026-05-20 local refresh results:

- `find fixtures/runtime/skills -maxdepth 4 -type f | sort` passed and listed
  the existing generic `issue-intake` and `issue-to-pr` runtime fixtures.
- `test -f fixtures/external/nitrosend/issue-intake/api-source-thread.json`
  passed; a sanitized external-shaped Nitrosend fixture contract now exists.
- `cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p runx-contracts --test nitrosend_external_fixture -- --nocapture`
  passed: 2 tests, deriving a target runner plan and provider dedupe lookup
  from the fixture and validating the cited post-merge harness receipt.
- A direct contract-level policy check against
  `fixtures/operational-policy/nitrosend-like.json` passed with no findings and
  projected a readback that redacts raw Slack/Sentry source locators.
- `pnpm vitest run packages/contracts/src/schemas/operational-policy.test.ts`
  passed: 23 tests.
- Static target coverage check passed for `nitrosend/nitrosend`,
  `nitrosend/api`, and `nitrosend/app` across targets, runner target repos, and
  owner routes.
- The retired-artifact guard passed:
  `! rg -n "runx\\.issue_to_pr_outcome\\.v1|issue_to_pr_outcome|verification[_-]report|target[_-]?effect|\"effect\"\\s*:" fixtures/runtime fixtures/operational-policy skills crates/runx-runtime`.
- `git diff --check -- .scafld/specs/drafts/rust-nitrosend-dogfood.md fixtures/operational-policy/nitrosend-like.json packages/contracts/src/schemas/operational-policy.test.ts packages/cli/src/index.test.ts packages/cli/src/commands/policy.ts`
  passed before this evidence note was added.
- `pnpm build` passed and refreshed ignored workspace `dist` output after the
  receipts sunset removed `@runxhq/core/receipts`.
- `pnpm --filter @runxhq/cli run runx policy lint fixtures/operational-policy/nitrosend-like.json --json`
  passed with `status: "success"` and no findings.
- `pnpm --filter @runxhq/cli run runx policy inspect fixtures/operational-policy/nitrosend-like.json --json`
  passed with `status: "success"` and no findings.
- `cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p runx-contracts --test operational_policy -- --nocapture`
  passed: 9 tests, including Rust request-admission coverage for all three
  Nitrosend-like target repos plus unknown-target and missing-source-thread
  fail-closed cases.
- `cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p runx-contracts` passed.

2026-05-20 actual Nitrosend dogfood integration verification:

- Nitrosend `config/runx-issue-flow.json` now uses
  `runx.operational_policy.v1` directly for `nitrosend/nitrosend`,
  `nitrosend/api`, and `nitrosend/app`.
- Nitrosend issue-intake derives target workspaces from the operational policy
  `targets` list instead of the retired repo-local target-repository shape.
- Nitrosend harness fixtures now expect sealed `runx.harness_receipt.v1`
  receipts from the Rust binary.
- The actual Rust binary replayed the Nitrosend onboarding, segment, and
  issue-intake harness fixtures through `RUNX_BIN=.../crates/target/debug/runx`
  with no TypeScript fallback knobs.
- The generic runx `issue-intake` runtime fixtures were refreshed to the
  current Rust receipt closure reason (`process_closed`) and replay green.

Validation:

- `/Users/kam/dev/runx/runx/oss/crates/target/debug/runx policy lint config/runx-issue-flow.json --json`
  passed in the Nitrosend repo with no findings.
- `/Users/kam/dev/runx/runx/oss/crates/target/debug/runx policy inspect config/runx-issue-flow.json --json`
  passed in the Nitrosend repo and redacted raw locators via counts.
- `RUNX_BIN=/Users/kam/dev/runx/runx/oss/crates/target/debug/runx node --test scripts/onboarding.test.mjs scripts/segment-from-prose.test.mjs scripts/issue-intake.test.mjs scripts/github-issue-thread.test.mjs scripts/post-issue-intake-comments.test.mjs scripts/runx-target-outcome.test.mjs scripts/scafld-command-review.test.mjs scripts/runx-harness.test.mjs`
  passed in the Nitrosend repo: 128 tests, 0 skipped.
- `cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p runx-contracts` passed in
  runx OSS.
- `! rg -n "needs_resolution|runx\\.issue_to_pr_outcome\\.v1|issue_to_pr_outcome|verification[_-]report|target[_-]?effect|\"effect\"\\s*:|RUNX_JS_BIN|RUNX_NPM_PACKAGE|target_repositories|allowed_repositories|route_hints" scripts config fixtures/runx .github/workflows/issue-intake.yml .github/workflows/wrapper-ci.yml`
  passed in the Nitrosend repo.
- `! rg -n "runx\\.issue_to_pr_outcome\\.v1|issue_to_pr_outcome|verification[_-]report|target[_-]?effect|\"effect\"\\s*:" fixtures/runtime fixtures/operational-policy fixtures/external skills crates/runx-runtime`
  passed in runx OSS.
- `git diff --check` passed in Nitrosend; `git diff --check -- fixtures/runtime/skills/issue-intake/cases .scafld/specs/drafts/rust-nitrosend-dogfood.md`
  passed in runx OSS.

Remaining blocker:

- Live target PR creation and final post-merge/provider observation still depend
  on the reusable `runx-target-repo-runners` and
  `runx-post-merge-closure-observer` work. No external replay was added here.

2026-05-21 Segment dogfood evidence verification:

- `scripts/segment-from-prose.mjs` now validates the returned sealed Runx
  result contains an embedded `runx.harness_receipt.v1` receipt and returns
  `receipt_id` to success and rejection callers.
- `scripts/segment-from-prose.test.mjs` now asserts the surfaced `receipt_id`
  and rejects non-harness receipt evidence.
- `RUNX_BIN=/Users/kam/dev/runx/runx/oss/crates/target/debug/runx node --test scripts/segment-from-prose.test.mjs scripts/runx-harness.test.mjs`
  passed in the Nitrosend repo: 12 tests, 0 skipped.

2026-05-20 narrow policy-fixture slice verification:

- The current safe slice is limited to verifying the Nitrosend-like policy and
  external dogfood fixture cover `nitrosend/api` alongside
  `nitrosend/nitrosend` and `nitrosend/app`.
- Static fixture coverage passed for all three repos across policy targets,
  runner `target_repos`, and owner-route `target_repos`.
- Focused Rust contract tests passed for operational policy admission,
  Nitrosend external fixture derivation, and target-runner planning/dedupe.
- TypeScript operational-policy fixture tests passed.
- CLI policy lint/inspect passed with no findings and redacted source
  locators.
- `scafld validate rust-nitrosend-dogfood --json` passed. `scafld build` and
  `scafld complete` were not run because this parent dogfood spec remains a
  draft with runtime replay acceptance still intentionally pending.

Future validation once the missing external fixture and runner/observer specs
land:

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p runx-runtime nitrosend_issue_intake
cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p runx-receipts
```

## Rollback And Repair

- Before any Nitrosend launcher flip, rollback is to keep the existing
  production path unchanged and disable Rust side-by-side validation.
- If the Nitrosend-like policy fixture later omits a real target such as
  `nitrosend/api`, repair the policy fixture and policy admission tests rather
  than adding special-case runtime routing.
- If an external-shaped fixture is accidentally generated from live traffic,
  replace it with a sanitized deterministic fixture before merging.
- If retired artifact fields appear in fixtures or replay output, repair the
  producer and expected receipts. Do not whitelist retired fields.

## Open Questions

- Exact Rust binary pinning mechanism for Nitrosend CI.
- Whether Nitrosend wrapper behavior remains repo-local or is fully absorbed by
  reusable runx target-runner and post-merge observer code.
- Soak duration after fixture parity is green.
