# Rust dev

## Current State

Status: draft
Current phase: none
Next: approve
Reason: draft created under `plans/rust-takeover.md`. Covers `runx dev`.
Blockers: `rust-runtime-skeleton`, `rust-harness`.
Allowed follow-up command: `scafld harden rust-dev`
Latest runner update: none
Review gate: not_started

## Summary

Port `runx dev` to Rust. Dev mode runs a skill or chain in an iterative
loop with file watch, fast-feedback receipts, and harness wiring. Today
this lives in `packages/cli/src/commands/dev/` and consumes runner-local
plus harness primitives.

## Context

CWD: `.`

Packages:
- `@runxhq/cli` (dev command tree)
- `@runxhq/runtime-local` (runner-local, harness)
- `crates/runx-runtime`

Current TypeScript sources:
- `packages/cli/src/commands/dev/**`
- `packages/cli/src/commands/dev.ts`
- `packages/runtime-local/src/harness/runner.ts`

Files impacted:
- `crates/runx-runtime/src/dev/watch.rs`
- `crates/runx-runtime/src/dev/loop.rs`
- `crates/runx-runtime/src/dev/presentation.rs`
- `fixtures/dev/**`

Invariants:
- File watch debounce and ignore patterns match TS.
- Dev mode never silently consumes secrets; reuses connect grants.
- Receipts emitted in dev are clearly tagged as dev-mode in metadata.

## Objectives

- Port dev mode loop with file watch.
- Match presentation (terminal output) to TS via snapshot tests.

## Scope

In scope:
- Dev loop, file watch, presentation.

Out of scope:
- New dev features beyond TS.

## Dependencies

- `rust-runtime-skeleton`.
- `rust-harness`.

## Open Questions

- File watch library choice (notify, watchexec). Defer to Phase 1.
