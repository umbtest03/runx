## Summary

Drive the Rust pure-kernel port end-to-end across multiple sessions without
data loss. This is the umbrella spec that orchestrates the pre-kernel
contracts bootstrap plus the four kernel parity sub-specs
(`rust-contracts-bootstrap`, `rust-kernel-parity-fixtures`,
`rust-state-machine-parity`, `rust-policy-parity`,
`rust-parity-ci-governance`) through their scafld
lifecycles (harden, approve, execute, review, complete) in the correct
order, with mandatory artifact handoff verification between phases.

The orchestration spec does not write code directly. It enforces the
discipline that any agent executing the port must follow. The phases are
gates: each gate verifies the previous sub-spec produced its checked-in
artifacts and passed its own review before the next sub-spec is approved.

This spec leverages scafld's strict execution profile, mandatory review
gate, harden-before-approve interrogation, per-phase checkpointing, and
rollback-on-fail to make agent drift, scope creep, and silent-skip
failures visible across a multi-week port. It does not claim to complete the
runtime, MCP, adapter, parser, receipt, or CLI cutover work. Those follow the
kernel port and have their own specs.

This spec depends on the architecture decisions in
`oss/docs/rust-kernel-architecture.md` (sections 2 pure-kernel-scope, 3
crate-graph ordering, and 12 dual-tree maintenance policy) and assumes
all five orchestrated sub-specs are in `status: draft`.

## Context

CWD: `.`

Packages:
- `@runxhq/core`
- `crates/runx-core` (placeholder upgraded during the port)

Files impacted:
- `.scafld/specs/drafts/rust-kernel-parity-fixtures.md` (Phase 1
  discipline lock)
- `.scafld/specs/drafts/rust-contracts-bootstrap.md` (Phase 1 discipline
  lock; Phase 2 pre-kernel gate)
- `.scafld/specs/drafts/rust-state-machine-parity.md` (Phase 1)
- `.scafld/specs/drafts/rust-policy-parity.md` (Phase 1)
- `.scafld/specs/drafts/rust-parity-ci-governance.md` (Phase 1)
- `docs/rust-kernel-architecture.md` (reference; not modified)
- This spec (`rust-kernel-port-orchestration.md`) for Current State and Phase
  Receipts updates as phases complete.

Invariants:
- Sub-specs are approved one at a time. No parallel approval; no skipping.
- Every sub-spec runs `scafld harden` before `scafld approve`. No exceptions.
- Every sub-spec runs `scafld review` (external provider, not local) before
  status flips to completed.
- No workspace edits during `scafld review`. The mutation guard discards the
  packet; an edit kills the review.
- No deferral of in-scope sub-spec work by relabeling it "out of scope mid
  execution." Use the deviations mechanism with explicit user approval.
- No threshold lowering when tests fail. Fix the test or fix the code; the
  goalpost does not move.
- No `scafld complete` on this orchestration spec while any sub-spec is
  still in_progress.
- Phase Receipts are written at the moment a phase completes. A phase is
  not complete without a Receipt.
- Cross-session resume reads Current State first; never re-derives port
  progress from git log or guesswork.

Related docs:
- `docs/rust-kernel-architecture.md` (prerequisite reading)
- `docs/trusted-kernel-package-truth.md`
- `oss/.scafld/config.yaml` (the validation/review/harden machinery this
  spec leans on)
- `AGENTS.md`

## Objectives

- Sequence the pre-kernel and kernel sub-specs in dependency order: contracts
  bootstrap, fixtures, state-machine, policy, CI governance.
- Bake `profile: strict`, `self_eval_threshold >= 8`, mandatory external
  review, and mandatory harden-before-approve into each sub-spec via
  Phase 1.
- Define the artifact handoff contract between phases (what files must
  exist after phase N before phase N+1 can begin).
- Define the Phase Receipts format (extension to standard spec layout) so
  evidence of each phase's completion survives across sessions.
- Define the cross-session resume protocol so a fresh agent in week 6 can
  pick up exactly where week 1 left off.
- Define the rollback semantics for the whole port (per-sub-spec rollback
  is the unit; this orchestration tracks which phases need rolling).
- Leave the Phase A advisory soak and promotion-to-blocking gate to
  `rust-kernel-blocking-promotion`, which runs only after this kernel port
  completes and 5 clean kernel-touching PRs have landed.

## Scope

In scope:
- Orchestration of `rust-contracts-bootstrap`, `rust-kernel-parity-fixtures`,
  `rust-state-machine-parity`, `rust-policy-parity`, and
  `rust-parity-ci-governance` through their scafld lifecycles.
- Modification of the four sub-specs' acceptance frontmatter to lock the
  discipline standards in Phase 1.
- Phase Receipts tracking per phase.
- Handoff to the follow-up `rust-kernel-blocking-promotion` spec.

Out of scope:
- `rust-cli-feature-parity-matrix` and `rust-runx-cli-placeholder`.
  Adjacent specs; their own orchestration spec if needed.
- `rust-sdk-surface-parity`. Adjacent SDK work; it may ship as a CLI-backed
  client, but it is not part of the pure-kernel port.
- Full `rust-contracts-parity`. Only `rust-contracts-bootstrap` is part of
  this kernel orchestration; complete contract parity is SDK/runtime work.
- Blocking promotion after the advisory soak. That is owned by
  `rust-kernel-blocking-promotion`.
- Any parser, receipts, runtime, or CLI cutover work. Those are follow-up
  orchestration specs (`rust-impure-domain-orchestration`,
  `rust-runtime-orchestration`, `rust-cli-cutover-orchestration` once they
  exist).
- Authority-proof and public-work policy re-exports. Deferred to
  `rust-policy-authority-proof-parity` per the policy spec.
- Direct code writing. This spec coordinates; the sub-specs write.

## Dependencies

- `docs/rust-kernel-architecture.md` exists and is approved.
- The five orchestrated sub-specs exist in `.scafld/specs/drafts/` at
  status `draft`.
- Scafld config at `oss/.scafld/config.yaml` has `strict_spec_adherence:
  true`, `checkpoint_frequency: per_phase`, `rollback_on_fail: true`,
  `self_review: mandatory` (it does, as of 2026-05-17).
- An external review provider is configured (Claude). Local
  review cannot satisfy complete.

## Assumptions

- An agent executing this spec spans many sessions. Persistent state lives
  in the spec file on disk, not in any single session's context.
- The advisory soak is calendar-independent and intentionally not part of
  this orchestration. If the kernel does not see 5 PRs that touch
  state-machine or policy after advisory CI lands, `rust-kernel-blocking-
  promotion` blocks indefinitely. This is correct behavior, not a bug.
- Sub-specs may surface deviations during their own execution. Deviations
  flow up: this orchestration spec's Phase Receipts record sub-spec
  deviations so the cumulative deviation budget is visible at the port
  level, not buried in individual sub-specs.
- The Phase 1 discipline lock is allowed to modify sub-specs even though
  they are status `draft`. After Phase 1, sub-specs are still draft but
  their acceptance frontmatter is hardened.
- Self-eval threshold 9 is intentional and aggressive. This forces a
  second pass on anything 8 or below. Default of 7 is too permissive for
  a trust-boundary port.

## Touchpoints

- Scafld lifecycle commands: `harden`, `approve`, `status`, `review`,
  `complete`, `fail`, and `cancel`.
- Five sub-spec files in `.scafld/specs/drafts/`.
- The architecture doc (read-only reference).
- Validation pipeline profiles (strict profile across the port).
- External review providers (Claude per scafld
  config).

## Risks

- High: agent context loss across sessions. Mitigated by Current State as
  the source of truth, Phase Receipts as the audit log, and an explicit
  resume protocol.
- High: silent scope drift. Mitigated by `strict_spec_adherence: true`,
  the `scope_drift` adversarial review pass, and explicit anti-pattern
  invariants.
- High: "good enough" false completion. Mitigated by mandatory external
  review per sub-spec, self_eval_threshold 9, and the requirement that no
  phase completes without a Receipt.
- Medium: dual-tree maintenance fatigue mid-port causing scope reduction.
  Mitigated by the cost estimate baked into the arch doc section 12 and
  the explicit advisory soak phase.
- Medium: blocking promotion may wait indefinitely if kernel churn stops
  before 5 clean kernel-touching PRs. This is delegated to
  `rust-kernel-blocking-promotion` so the kernel port itself can complete
  with advisory checks enabled.
- Medium: review provider unavailability stalls phases. Mitigated by
  scafld config's `fallback_policy: warn` and dual provider support.
- Low: cross-spec dependency confusion if sub-spec files are reordered or
  renamed during execution. Mitigated by final coherence verification.

## Phase 1: Discipline lock on sub-specs

Goal: Bake the strict discipline standards into each kernel parity sub-spec
before any of them is approved. This is the only phase that modifies
sub-spec files. After this phase, sub-spec acceptance frontmatter is
frozen.

Status: pending
Dependencies: none

Changes:
- `.scafld/specs/drafts/rust-kernel-parity-fixtures.md` (partial, shared) -
  Set `Profile: strict` in Acceptance (already set; verify), add explicit
  `Self-eval threshold: 8` line in Acceptance, add explicit
  `Review provider: external Claude; local review does not
  satisfy complete.` line, add explicit `Harden required before approve:
  yes` line.
- `.scafld/specs/drafts/rust-contracts-bootstrap.md` (partial, shared) -
  same four additions.
- `.scafld/specs/drafts/rust-state-machine-parity.md` (partial, shared) -
  same four additions.
- `.scafld/specs/drafts/rust-policy-parity.md` (partial, shared) - same
  four additions.
- `.scafld/specs/drafts/rust-parity-ci-governance.md` (partial, shared) -
  same four additions, plus raise `Profile:` to `strict` if not already.

Acceptance:
- [ ] `ac1_1` command - every sub-spec has strict profile.
  - Command: `for s in rust-contracts-bootstrap rust-kernel-parity-fixtures rust-state-machine-parity rust-policy-parity rust-parity-ci-governance; do rg -n 'Profile: strict' ".scafld/specs/drafts/$s.md" >/dev/null || exit 1; done`
  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Status: pending
- [ ] `ac1_2` command - every sub-spec names self-eval threshold >= 8.
  - Command: `for s in rust-contracts-bootstrap rust-kernel-parity-fixtures rust-state-machine-parity rust-policy-parity rust-parity-ci-governance; do rg -n 'Self-eval threshold: [89]' ".scafld/specs/drafts/$s.md" >/dev/null || exit 1; done`
  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Status: pending
- [ ] `ac1_3` command - every sub-spec requires external review.
  - Command: `for s in rust-contracts-bootstrap rust-kernel-parity-fixtures rust-state-machine-parity rust-policy-parity rust-parity-ci-governance; do rg -n 'Review provider: external' ".scafld/specs/drafts/$s.md" >/dev/null || exit 1; done`
  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Status: pending
- [ ] `ac1_4` command - every sub-spec requires harden before approve.
  - Command: `for s in rust-contracts-bootstrap rust-kernel-parity-fixtures rust-state-machine-parity rust-policy-parity rust-parity-ci-governance; do rg -n 'Harden required before approve: yes' ".scafld/specs/drafts/$s.md" >/dev/null || exit 1; done`
  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Status: pending

## Phase 2: Execute contracts bootstrap and rust-kernel-parity-fixtures

Goal: Drive the pre-kernel contracts bootstrap through its full lifecycle, then
drive the fixtures sub-spec through its full lifecycle. This keeps contracts
as a stable dependency before any `runx-core` implementation begins without
requiring full `rust-contracts-parity` to block the kernel.

Status: pending
Dependencies: Phase 1

Steps (the agent runs these in order; this is procedural, not declarative):
1. `scafld harden rust-contracts-bootstrap`. Answer every question.
   Do not skip the harden round.
2. `scafld approve rust-contracts-bootstrap`.
3. Execute the bootstrap sub-spec phases. Run validation per phase.
4. `scafld review rust-contracts-bootstrap`. No workspace edits during
   review. Poll `scafld status --json` for review progress.
5. If review verdict is `fail` or `conditional`, address findings and
   re-review. Do not run `scafld complete` until verdict is `pass`.
6. `scafld complete rust-contracts-bootstrap`.
7. `scafld harden rust-kernel-parity-fixtures`. Answer every question.
8. `scafld approve rust-kernel-parity-fixtures`.
9. Execute the fixtures sub-spec phases. Run validation per phase.
10. `scafld review rust-kernel-parity-fixtures`. No workspace edits during
    review.
11. If review verdict is `fail` or `conditional`, address findings and
    re-review. Do not run `scafld complete` until verdict is `pass`.
12. `scafld complete rust-kernel-parity-fixtures`.
13. Update Phase Receipts (Phase 2 entry) in this orchestration spec.

Acceptance:
- [ ] `ac2_1` command - contracts bootstrap is completed with review gate pass.
  - Command: `scafld status --json rust-contracts-bootstrap | jq -e '.result.status == "completed"' >/dev/null && p="$(find .scafld/specs -name rust-contracts-bootstrap.md -print -quit)" && test -n "$p" && rg -n 'Review gate: pass|Verdict: pass' "$p" >/dev/null`

  - Status: pending
- [ ] `ac2_6` command - Phase Receipts populated for Phase 2.
  - Command: `rg -n 'Phase 2 receipt: filled' .scafld/specs/drafts/rust-kernel-port-orchestration.md`

  - Command: `rg -n 'Phase 4 receipt: filled' .scafld/specs/drafts/rust-kernel-port-orchestration.md`
  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Status: pending

## Phase 5: Execute rust-parity-ci-governance

Goal: Drive the advisory CI governance sub-spec through its full lifecycle.
Blocking promotion is not part of this spec; it is owned by
`rust-kernel-blocking-promotion` after 5 clean kernel-touching PRs land.

Status: pending
Dependencies: Phase 4

Steps: same procedural pattern as Phase 2 with task id
`rust-parity-ci-governance`.

Acceptance:

## Phase 6: Coherence verification

Goal: Final check that all artifacts produced by phases 2-5 are still
present, validate against schema, and that the cross-spec dependency graph
is intact.

Status: pending
Dependencies: Phase 5

Changes:
- `.scafld/specs/drafts/rust-kernel-port-orchestration.md` (partial, exclusive) -

  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Status: pending
- [ ] `ac6_5` command - all Phase Receipts populated.

  - Status: pending

## Cross-session resume protocol

When a fresh agent picks up this spec mid-port:

1. Read `## Current State` in this file. Identify the in-progress phase.
2. Read `## Phase Receipts` and confirm which phases are filled vs not.
3. For the in-progress phase's sub-spec, run
   `scafld status --json <sub-spec-id>`.
4. Read the sub-spec's `## Current State` block.
5. Continue from the next pending action in the in-progress phase's Steps
   block.

Do not re-derive port progress from `git log`, file timestamps, or
guesswork. The Current State and Phase Receipts are the only authoritative
sources.

## Anti-patterns

The agent must not:

- Approve any sub-spec without running `scafld harden` first.
- Declare any phase complete without `scafld review` verdict `pass`.
- Edit any workspace file while `scafld review` is running. The mutation
  guard discards the packet; an edit kills the review.
- Modify a sub-spec's Scope, Objectives, or Acceptance after `scafld
  approve`. If scope must change, stop execution, record a deviation in the
  spec, and get explicit user approval before continuing.
- Defer in-scope sub-spec work by relabeling it "out of scope mid
  execution."
- Lower validation thresholds, fixture counts, or acceptance criteria when
  tests fail. Fix the test or the code; do not move the goalpost.
- Run `scafld complete` on this orchestration spec while any sub-spec is
  still in_progress.
- Run sub-specs in parallel. Scafld config has `parallel_execution: false`
  for a reason.
- Skip Phase Receipts updates. A phase is not complete without a Receipt.
- Re-derive port progress from git log or guesswork on resume.
- Claim "good enough" when self-eval falls below threshold 9. Perform the
  second pass.
- Add test-only branches in production code. The repo invariant
  `no_test_logic_in_production: true` applies.

## Rollback

Strategy: per_phase

A rollback unit is one phase of this orchestration. Sub-spec rollback is
delegated to each sub-spec's own rollback section.

Commands per phase:
- Phase 1: revert sub-spec acceptance frontmatter changes.
- Phase 2-5: follow each sub-spec's own rollback section manually, then clear
  that phase's Receipt. Scafld does not provide a rollback command.
- Phase 6: revert documentation finalization changes.

Whole-port rollback is the sequence: Phase 6 -> 5 -> ... -> 1, executed
explicitly. There is no atomic whole-port revert; this is by design.

Reviewer requirements specific to this orchestration spec:
- Reviewer model: claude-opus-4-7.
- Reviewer must run the adversarial passes `scope_drift`, `regression_hunt`,
  `convention_check`, `dark_patterns`.
- Reviewer must verify Phase Receipts are populated and consistent.
- Reviewer must verify all five orchestrated sub-specs are at status completed with
  their own review gates passed.
- Local review provider does not satisfy complete.

## Planning Log

- 2026-05-17T00:00:00Z: Drafted as umbrella orchestration for the four
  kernel parity sub-specs. Leverages scafld strict execution profile,
  mandatory external review, harden-before-approve, per-phase
  checkpointing, rollback-on-fail, and Phase Receipts (an extension to
  the standard layout) to prevent agent data loss across the multi-week
  port. Self-eval threshold raised from default 7 to 9. CLI parity and
  runtime cutover specs are deliberately out of scope; their own
  orchestration specs come later.
- 2026-05-17T02:10:00Z: Added `rust-contracts-bootstrap` as a pre-kernel
  gate. The full contracts parity port remains separate, but the crate graph,
  placeholder publish-readiness policy, and Rust guardrail scripts must
  complete before fixtures and kernel implementation begin. Reviews are
  Claude-only.
