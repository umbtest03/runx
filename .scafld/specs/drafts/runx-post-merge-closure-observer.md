# Runx post-merge closure observer

## Current State

Status: draft
Current phase: bounded live GitHub PR readback adapter slice
Next: provider adapter and target-runner integration slice after dependencies
Reason: issue-to-PR currently has a pure contract/runtime observer slice for
closure planning, dedupe, sealed receipt projection, and local
publication command projection. Runtime now has an abstract observer adapter
seam plus a fixture-backed GitHub PR observation/readback adapter that returns
deterministic PR and verification observations without network side effects.
Runtime also has a bounded HTTP-backed GitHub PR readback adapter over the
existing runtime HTTP seam; fixture/mock tests validate request/response
identity, map GitHub PR API state into the typed PR observation, and fail closed
without publication dedupe when readback mismatches or verification readback is
not configured. The remaining execution-ready gap is live webhook/scheduler
dispatch plus live target-runner verification/source readback and publication
transports.
Blockers: webhook/scheduler dispatch adapter; remaining live target/source
readback from `runx-target-repo-runners` including runner verification
hook/deploy context beyond GitHub PR API state; policy source configuration from
`runx-operational-policy-config` for source-thread publication and close mode;
real GitHub/Slack publication transports.
Allowed follow-up command: `scafld harden runx-post-merge-closure-observer --mark-passed`
Latest runner update: 2026-05-22T10:46:07+10:00 added a bounded HTTP-backed
GitHub PR readback adapter in `runx-runtime` behind the existing
`PostMergeObserverAdapter` seam. The adapter uses the existing runtime HTTP
transport, validates GitHub source issue/source thread/target PR command
identity before readback, issues only a typed GitHub PR GET through the
configured transport, maps provider PR state/merge SHA/actor timestamps into
the typed PR observation, and fails closed on HTTP/status/JSON/identity
mismatch before publication dedupe. The adapter intentionally fails closed at
verification readback until target-runner verification/deploy context is wired.
No webhook scheduler, source publication transport, target-runner mutation, or
real GitHub/Slack publication transport was added. The spec must stay draft
because live webhook/scheduler adapters, live source/target verification
readback, and real GitHub/Slack publication transports remain unimplemented.
Earlier on 2026-05-22T00:00:00+10:00 added a fixture-backed GitHub PR
observation/readback adapter behind the existing `PostMergeObserverAdapter`
seam in `runx-runtime`. The adapter loads deterministic fixture data, validates
GitHub source issue/source thread/target PR identity before readback, returns
the observed PR state plus verification observation, and fails closed on
fixture/request mismatch without marking publication dedupe. No webhook
scheduler, source publication transport, target-runner mutation, or network
GitHub transport was added. The spec must stay draft because real live GitHub
observer/webhook/scheduler adapters, live source/target readback, and real
GitHub/Slack publication transports remain unimplemented. Earlier on
2026-05-21T22:05:00+10:00 dogfood audit confirmed this
spec must stay draft: local command/readback projection exists, but live
GitHub observer/webhook/scheduler adapters, live source/target readback, and
real GitHub/Slack publication transports remain unimplemented. Earlier on
2026-05-21 fixed the target-runner source issue reference shape used by
observer commands: source-publication receipts now carry the
durable GitHub issue as provider `github` with a GitHub issue locator, while
the Slack source-thread reference remains Slack-scoped. A contract regression
now feeds target-runner source publication refs directly into post-merge
observer command normalization and proves source issue, source thread, and
target PR refs pass before adapter readback. Earlier on 2026-05-21 added typed
live observer command normalization before adapter readback. Webhook commands
now require a
`webhook_delivery` signal reference with provider/locator metadata; scheduler
commands may omit a signal ref; both normalize to the same source issue plus
target PR command key. Source issue, source thread, and target PR references
fail closed before any adapter observation when type/provider/locator context is
missing. Earlier on 2026-05-21 the slice hardened sealed final-publication
projection so local publication now requires a target PR ref from the receipt,
requires merge SHA metadata for merged closures, projects verification
summaries, and renders source issue, target PR, merge SHA, review-gate,
closure, verification, proof, next-human-action, and receipt fields in final
replies.
The same day also added local runtime failed-verification final reply
projection from a sealed receipt without issuing a source issue close command.
Earlier local slices added closed-unmerged sealed receipt publication
projection without fabricating verification proof or issuing a source issue
close command, Rust contract-level
repeated observer signal idempotency proof for duplicate local provider
observations, missing source-thread fail-closed routing before provider-state
classification, stable webhook/scheduler runtime dedupe planning, sealed
receipt publication projection gates, and local runtime command
projection for source issue comments, source-thread replies, and
policy-authorized source issue close commands. Provider adapters remain
pending.
Review gate: not_started

## Summary

Add a reusable post-merge closure/proof observer for runx issue-to-PR flows. It
observes PR merge/close state, runs policy-defined verification, seals the
observed state and verification proof into receipts, updates the source
GitHub issue, posts the final Slack/source-thread reply, and closes or marks
the issue according to policy.

The observer does not auto-merge. Human merge remains the default final gate;
the observer publishes what happened after that gate.

## Context

CWD: `.` (runx OSS workspace)

Production story to support:
1. Intake creates a source issue from Slack/Sentry/GitHub.
2. runx triages and creates or links a target PR.
3. Human reviewer approves/merges or closes the PR.
4. runx observes the result.
5. runx runs verification appropriate to the target.
6. runx posts a concise final reply to the original Slack thread and source
   GitHub issue.
7. runx closes or labels the issue when policy allows.

Candidate touchpoints:
- GitHub adapter/outbox receipt builders.
- `skills/issue-to-pr/**`
- `skills/work-plan/**`
- Runtime receipt projection model.
- Aster observer scheduling and status surfaces.

Invariants:
- Observer is idempotent by source issue, PR, act form, and closure key.
- Source thread metadata must be present before Slack publishing.
- Closed-unmerged, merged-pending-verification, merged-verified,
  failed-verification, and superseded closures are distinct.
- Verification output is reviewer-safe and redacted.
- No hidden auto-merge path is introduced.
- The observer never emits a legacy peer terminal artifact. It seals a follow-on
  receipt whose contained acts use `form: "observation"`,
  `form: "verification"`, `form: "reply"`, or `form: "revision"` as needed.
- Source issue closure and final source-thread publication require a sealed
  receipt with closure and `proof.verification` criteria.

## Objectives

- Define the receipt closure/proof model for merged, closed-unmerged,
  superseded, verification-passed, and verification-failed observations.
- Define criterion ids, reference roles, closure reason codes, and idempotency
  keys for provider state, PR state, human gate, verification, close policy,
  and source-thread targets.
- Add provider observer for GitHub PR state changes.
- Add policy-driven verification hook that records verification as a contained
  act with `form: "verification"` inside a sealed receipt.
- Publish final reply to source GitHub issue and Slack/source thread.
- Add idempotency/dedupe for repeated webhook or scheduled observer runs.
- Add fixtures for merged verified, merged failed verify, closed unmerged,
  missing source thread, and repeated observer signals.

## Scope

In scope:
- Core post-merge observer harness contract.
- GitHub PR state observer.
- Policy-driven verification command/hook contract.
- Final issue and source-thread publishing.
- Issue close/label behavior when policy allows.
- Tests and fixtures.

Out of scope:
- Automatic PR merge.
- Provider-specific deployment integrations beyond a hook boundary.
- Slack listener/reaction intake.
- Nitrosend-only script details except as reference fixtures.

## Dependencies

- `runx-operational-policy-config`.
- `runx-target-repo-runners` for cross-repo source/target context.
- `rust-runtime-receipt-path-discovery` for receipt storage.
- `rust-receipt-proof-verification` for sealed receipt proof verification.

## Assumptions

- GitHub is the initial PR provider.
- Deploy verification can start as command/provider hook output with a stable
  contract before richer hosted integrations land.
- Source-thread publishing can use the same outbox act/receipt projection model
  as earlier milestone comments.

## Touchpoints

- Provider adapter for PR state.
- Outbox/feed receipt builders.
- Runtime receipt summaries.
- Policy config.
- Aster observer scheduling/status.

## Risks

- Duplicate webhook deliveries can create noisy final comments.
- Missing source-thread metadata can cause root-channel Slack posts.
- Verification logs can leak secrets or local paths if not redacted.
- Closing issues before verification can hide unresolved bugs.

## Acceptance

Profile: strict

Validation:
- `pnpm test`
- `cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml`
- post-merge-observer fixture command
- `git diff --check`

Required behavior:
- [ ] Merged PR with passing verification posts one final source issue comment,
  one final source-thread reply, and closes/labels according to policy.
- [ ] Merged PR with failing verification posts a final reply projected from a
  failed verification act and leaves the source issue open unless policy
  explicitly says otherwise. Local runtime command projection now covers this;
  live provider posting remains pending.
- [x] Closed-unmerged PR projects a distinct sealed observation closure and
  local source issue/source-thread publication commands without claiming a fix
  shipped or closing the source issue. Live provider posting remains pending.
- [x] Repeated observer signal is idempotent at the Rust contract planning
  layer; webhook and scheduler signals share one runtime dedupe receipt
  identity before publication.
- [x] Webhook and scheduler live observer commands normalize to one source
  issue plus target PR command key, and malformed source/target/webhook context
  fails closed before provider adapter readback.
- [x] Fixture-backed GitHub PR observation/readback adapter uses the existing
  runtime observer seam, validates fixture/request identity, returns deterministic
  PR and verification readback, and fails closed on mismatch without publication
  dedupe. Real GitHub transport remains pending.
- [x] HTTP-backed GitHub PR observation adapter uses the existing runtime HTTP
  seam, validates command and provider readback identity, maps GitHub PR API
  state into the typed PR observation, and fails closed without publication
  dedupe on response mismatch or missing verification readback. Webhook dispatch,
  target-runner verification readback, and live publication transports remain
  pending.
- [x] Missing source Slack thread fails Slack publish cleanly without posting to
  channel root. Rust contract planning now fails closed before provider-state
  classification when source-thread metadata is missing, and the local runtime
  command projection fails closed when sealed source-thread provider/locator
  metadata is missing. Live provider adapters remain pending.
- [ ] Final publication is backed by a sealed receipt containing issue
  link, PR link, merge sha when available, verification summary, closure reason,
  and next human action. Local projection now requires the sealed target PR ref,
  requires merge SHA metadata for merged closures, distinguishes proof criteria
  from optional verification criteria for closed-unmerged receipts, and renders
  the full context fields in local commands; live publication remains pending.
- [x] Final publication validates by reading the sealed receipt and
  required closure/proof criteria before publication; source issue close still
  requires proof-bound verification criteria.
- [x] Final publication excludes absolute local paths, raw env vars, secrets,
  and excessive logs at the local runtime command-projection boundary.
- [ ] No fixture, emitted artifact, schema id, or persisted receipt uses a
  retired peer terminal artifact shape; terminal state is represented only as
  sealed receipt closure plus `proof.verification` criteria.

## Phase 1: Closure/Proof Model

Status: pending
Dependencies: `runx-operational-policy-config`

Objective: Define the observer harness, contained acts, closures, references,
criterion ids, and idempotency keys.

Changes:
- Add observer receipt fixture shape.
- Add contained act forms for provider observation, deployment verification,
  source-thread reply, and policy-authorized issue close/label revision.
- Add closure reason code rules and criterion id binding to receipt
  proof.
- Add idempotency key rules.
- Add policy validation for closure and publication actions.

Acceptance:
- [ ] Fixtures cover every closure state and contain no retired peer terminal
  artifacts.

## Phase 2: Observer

Status: pending
Dependencies: Phase 1

Objective: Observe provider PR state and run verification.

Changes:
- Add GitHub PR observer adapter.
- Add verification hook contract.
- Seal observer receipts and link them to the source receipt
  tree.

Acceptance:
- [ ] Merged, closed, and repeated signal fixtures produce correct closures,
  verification proof, and idempotent receipt refs.

## Phase 3: Publishing

Status: pending
Dependencies: Phase 2

Objective: Publish the final reply and issue updates to the original source
surfaces from sealed receipt projections.

Changes:
- Publish source issue comment from sealed receipt projection.
- Publish source Slack/source-thread reply only when thread metadata is present.
- Close/label source issue according to policy through a contained revision act.

Acceptance:
- [ ] Source-thread fixture posts no root-channel messages.
- [ ] Final comment is concise but contains review-gate, closure, and
  verification state projected from the sealed receipt.

## Rollback

- Keep repo-local observer scripts until core observer fixtures are green, then
  migrate adopters and remove duplicated observer logic. Do not introduce
  compatibility aliases or shim artifacts; cutover removes duplicated observer
  logic directly.

## Planning Log

- 2026-05-19: Expanded placeholder into post-merge observer contract.
- 2026-05-19: Reconciled with the harness-spine hard cutover. The observer no
  longer defines a terminal packet; Rust, Aster, and repo wrappers must
  consume sealed receipts with contained observation, verification,
  reply, and revision acts.
- 2026-05-20: `runx-post-merge-observer-idempotency-contract` added a pure Rust
  planner proof that repeated merged-and-verified provider observations keep
  the same closure key, act forms, and idempotency identity without live GitHub.
- 2026-05-20: Added a pure Rust planner regression proving missing
  source-thread metadata fails closed before terminal provider-state
  classification, so this local contract slice cannot plan a root-channel
  fallback.
- 2026-05-20: Added the contract runtime dedupe plan that gives webhook and
  scheduler observations the same post-merge observer receipt identity, plus a
  sealed receipt projection gate for final publication and issue close.
- 2026-05-20: Added the runtime/publication slice in `runx-runtime`: it consumes
  `PostMergeObserverRuntimeDedupePlan` plus a sealed receipt, emits only
  deterministic source issue comment, source-thread reply, and authorized close
  commands, dedupes repeated webhook/scheduler publication by publication key,
  fails closed on missing source-thread provider/locator metadata, and sanitizes
  public command text for local paths and env-secret assignments. The spec stays
  draft because live provider adapters and end-to-end publication fixtures are
  still pending.
- 2026-05-20: Reworded the draft away from retired peer terminal vocabulary.
  The remaining contract language is sealed receipt closure plus
  `proof.verification` criteria, with no compatibility shim or legacy peer
  artifact contract.
- 2026-05-21: Added local runtime failed-verification publication projection:
  source issue and source-thread final replies include review gate, closure,
  verification, proof, next human action, and receipt while avoiding source
  issue close. Live provider adapters and target-runner source/target context
  remain blockers.
- 2026-05-21: Hardened sealed final-publication projection to require target PR
  evidence and merged-closure merge SHA metadata from the receipt before local
  command projection. Final replies now include source issue, target PR, merge
  SHA/not_available, verification summary, review gate, closure, proof, next
  human action, and receipt. `cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p
  runx-contracts --test post_merge_observer` passed; `cargo test
  --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p runx-runtime --test
  post_merge_observer` passed after the target-runner source-publication helper
  integration landed.
- 2026-05-21: Added typed live observer command normalization for webhook and
  scheduler triggers. Contract normalization resolves the policy source,
  validates GitHub source issue and target PR refs, validates Slack source
  thread metadata when publication is required, requires webhook delivery refs
  for webhook-triggered runs, and keeps scheduler/webhook commands on one stable
  command key. Runtime live execution now normalizes the command before adapter
  calls, so malformed target context produces no provider readback. Focused
  `runx-contracts` and `runx-runtime` post-merge observer tests passed.
- 2026-05-21: Closed the local target-runner source-ref compatibility blocker.
  Target-runner source-publication receipt planning now emits the durable source
  GitHub issue with provider `github` and locator `owner/repo#number` instead
  of inheriting the Slack source provider/locator. Added a post-merge observer
  contract regression that uses target-runner source-publication refs as the
  observer command input and proves source issue, Slack source thread, target
  PR, and webhook refs normalize before adapter readback. Focused
  `runx-contracts` post-merge observer and target-runner tests passed, as did
  the matching `runx-runtime` post-merge observer and target-runner tests.
- 2026-05-21: Added live source-publication adapter/readback planning in
  `runx-runtime` without network side effects. The runtime now builds a typed
  source-publication request from the sealed receipt projection, requires
  provider readback proof for the GitHub issue comment, Slack thread reply,
  source issue close, and receipt ref before marking publication dedupe, and
  fails closed without marking dedupe when readback is incomplete. Real
  GitHub/Slack transport remains pending.
- 2026-05-22: Added the next safe provider-observer slice without widening
  transport scope. `runx-runtime` now includes a
  `FixtureBackedGitHubPostMergeObserverAdapter` behind the existing abstract
  observer seam, backed by
  `fixtures/contracts/post-merge-observer/github-pr-merged-verified-observation.json`.
  Focused runtime tests prove deterministic GitHub PR/verification readback and
  mismatch fail-closed behavior before publication dedupe. Real GitHub
  transport, webhook/scheduler dispatch, source publication transports, and
  target-runner readback remain blockers.
- 2026-05-22: Added the bounded live GitHub PR readback slice without real
  network side effects in tests. `runx-runtime` now has an HTTP-backed GitHub PR
  observer adapter over the existing runtime HTTP seam; it validates source
  issue/source thread/target PR identity, maps GitHub PR API state into the
  typed pull-request observation, redacts auth headers through the shared HTTP
  request debug path, and fails closed before publication dedupe on mismatched
  readback or unconfigured verification readback. Webhook/scheduler dispatch,
  target-runner verification/deploy readback, source readback, and GitHub/Slack
  publication transports remain blockers.
