# Rust kernel blocking promotion

## Current State

Status: draft
Current phase: none
Next: approve
Reason: draft created
Blockers: `rust-kernel-port-orchestration` must complete first, and 5 clean
kernel-touching PRs must land while Rust kernel parity checks are advisory
Allowed follow-up command: `scafld harden rust-kernel-blocking-promotion`
Latest runner update: none
Review gate: not_started

## Summary

Promote Rust kernel parity from advisory CI signal to blocking CI gate after
the advisory soak proves the dual-tree workflow is sustainable. This spec is
deliberately separate from `rust-parity-ci-governance` because scafld specs are
completed once; the advisory-to-blocking flip is a later operational decision,
not a phase that can be reopened inside the completed governance spec.

The trigger is not calendar time. The trigger is 5 clean kernel-touching PRs
merged after advisory CI lands. A clean kernel-touching PR touches
`packages/core/src/state-machine/` or `packages/core/src/policy/`, runs the
Rust parity checks, and either passes them directly or includes an intentional
fixture refresh that makes both TypeScript and Rust pass.

## Context

CWD: `.`

Packages:
- `@runxhq/core`
- `crates/runx-core`

Files impacted:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `scripts/count-clean-kernel-prs.ts`
- `docs/rust-kernel-architecture.md`
- `docs/trusted-kernel-package-truth.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`

Invariants:
- TypeScript remains authoritative until a later cutover spec changes a
  consumer.
- Rust kernel parity checks do not become blocking until 5 clean
  kernel-touching PRs are evidenced.
- The promotion only affects Rust kernel parity checks added by
  `rust-parity-ci-governance`. It must not remove existing Rust launcher CI
  checks or change npm CLI release behavior.
- The CLI feature-parity matrix remains required for any runtime or CLI
  cutover. Blocking kernel parity is not a runtime cutover.
- If the 5-PR evidence is missing or ambiguous, this spec blocks.

Related docs:
- `docs/rust-kernel-architecture.md`
- `docs/trusted-kernel-package-truth.md`
- `.scafld/specs/drafts/rust-kernel-port-orchestration.md`
- `.scafld/specs/drafts/rust-parity-ci-governance.md`

## Objectives

- Add a deterministic way to count clean kernel-touching PRs.
- Verify at least 5 qualifying PRs landed while Rust kernel checks were
  advisory.
- Remove `continue-on-error: true` from the Rust kernel parity checks added by
  `rust-parity-ci-governance`.
- Update docs to state Phase B is active and kernel parity is blocking.
- Keep runtime, MCP, adapter, parser, receipt, and CLI cutover work out of
  scope.

## Scope

In scope:
- Evidence collection for the 5 clean kernel-touching PR trigger.
- CI promotion from advisory to blocking for Rust kernel parity checks.
- Documentation updates that mark Phase B active.

Out of scope:
- Any Rust implementation changes.
- Any TypeScript kernel behavior changes.
- Any parser, receipt, runtime-local, MCP, adapter, or CLI cutover.
- Publishing Cargo crates.

## Dependencies

- `rust-kernel-port-orchestration` completed.
- `rust-parity-ci-governance` completed with advisory CI checks present.
- GitHub CLI or equivalent CI metadata access is available for counting merged
  PRs. If not available, the operator must provide audited PR evidence and the
  script must support a checked-in fixture mode.

## Assumptions

- The advisory start timestamp is recorded in
  `rust-kernel-port-orchestration` Phase 5 receipt.
- The CI workflow names for Rust kernel parity checks are stable enough for
  `scripts/count-clean-kernel-prs.ts` to identify them.
- Some qualifying PRs may include fixture refreshes. That is acceptable only if
  the PR also shows both TypeScript and Rust parity passing after refresh.

## Risks

- High: promoting too early can block normal TypeScript kernel work. Mitigated
  by the 5 clean PR evidence gate.
- High: PR counting can be wrong if CI check names change. Mitigated by a
  script with explicit check-name configuration and fixture tests.
- Medium: advisory checks may have been bypassed manually. Mitigated by
  requiring PR-level evidence, not just current branch green status.
- Medium: CI promotion can accidentally affect existing launcher checks.
  Mitigated by limiting the workflow diff to the parity checks added by
  `rust-parity-ci-governance`.

## Acceptance

Profile: strict
Self-eval threshold: 8
Review provider: external Claude; local review does not satisfy
complete.
Harden required before approve: yes

Definition of done:

  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Timeout seconds: 60
  - Status: pending
- [ ] `v3` command - Rust kernel parity checks are no longer advisory.
  - Command: `! rg -n 'continue-on-error: true' .github/workflows/ci.yml | rg -qE 'cargo-deny|cargo public-api|check-rust-kernel-parity'`
  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Status: pending

## Phase 1: Evidence script

Goal: Add a script that identifies clean kernel-touching PRs and can be tested
without live GitHub access.

Status: pending
Dependencies: none

Changes:
- `scripts/count-clean-kernel-prs.ts` (all, exclusive) - Count merged PRs that
  touch `packages/core/src/state-machine/` or `packages/core/src/policy/` and
  have passing Rust kernel parity checks.
- `tests/count-clean-kernel-prs.test.ts` (all, exclusive) - Fixture tests for
  clean PRs, non-kernel PRs, missing CI checks, failed CI checks, and fixture
  refresh PRs.

Acceptance:
- [ ] `ac1_1` command - script tests pass.
  - Command: `pnpm exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts tests/count-clean-kernel-prs.test.ts`
  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Status: pending
- [ ] `ac1_2` command - script exposes fixture mode.
  - Command: `pnpm exec tsx scripts/count-clean-kernel-prs.ts --fixture tests/fixtures/clean-kernel-prs.json --min 1`
  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Status: pending

## Phase 2: Soak verification

Goal: Verify 5 clean kernel-touching PRs using live metadata or audited
operator-provided fixture evidence.

Status: pending
Dependencies: Phase 1

Acceptance:
- [ ] `ac2_1` command - 5 qualifying PRs found.
  - Command: `pnpm exec tsx scripts/count-clean-kernel-prs.ts --min 5`
  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Timeout seconds: 60
  - Status: pending
- [ ] `ac2_2` command - evidence is recorded in this spec.
  - Command: `rg -n 'Clean PR evidence: filled' .scafld/specs/drafts/rust-kernel-blocking-promotion.md`
  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Status: pending

## Phase 3: CI promotion

Goal: Remove advisory markers from the Rust kernel parity checks only.

Status: pending
Dependencies: Phase 2

Changes:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (partial, shared) - Remove `continue-on-error:
  true` from Rust kernel parity checks added by `rust-parity-ci-governance`.
  Do not alter pre-existing Rust launcher checks.

Acceptance:
- [ ] `ac3_1` command - parity checks are blocking.
  - Command: `! rg -n 'continue-on-error: true' .github/workflows/ci.yml | rg -qE 'cargo-deny|cargo public-api|check-rust-kernel-parity'`
  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Status: pending
- [ ] `ac3_2` command - parity wrapper still passes.
  - Command: `node scripts/check-rust-kernel-parity.mjs`
  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Status: pending

## Phase 4: Docs

Goal: Mark Phase B active while preserving the TypeScript source-of-truth and
CLI feature-parity cutover rules.

Status: pending
Dependencies: Phase 3

Changes:
- `docs/rust-kernel-architecture.md` (partial, shared) - Mark Phase B active.
- `docs/trusted-kernel-package-truth.md` (partial, shared) - State that Rust
  kernel parity blocks kernel changes but does not authorize runtime/CLI
  cutover.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (partial, shared) - Document the blocking local check.

Acceptance:
- [ ] `ac4_1` command - docs mention Phase B active.
  - Command: `rg -n 'Phase B.*active|blocking.*kernel parity|kernel parity.*blocking' docs CONTRIBUTING.md`
  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Status: pending
- [ ] `ac4_2` command - docs still preserve CLI cutover gate.
  - Command: `rg -n 'cli-feature-parity|feature-parity matrix|runtime.*cutover|CLI.*cutover' docs CONTRIBUTING.md`
  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Status: pending

## Rollback

Strategy: per_phase

Commands:
- Phase 1: remove `scripts/count-clean-kernel-prs.ts` and its tests.
- Phase 2: clear the recorded PR evidence from this spec.
- Phase 3: re-add `continue-on-error: true` to the Rust kernel parity checks.
- Phase 4: revert docs from Phase B active back to advisory language.

## Planning Log

- 2026-05-17T00:30:00Z: Drafted as the separate blocking-promotion spec. This
  keeps `rust-parity-ci-governance` executable as an advisory CI spec and
  avoids the invalid assumption that a completed scafld spec can be reopened
  with a `deviate` command.
