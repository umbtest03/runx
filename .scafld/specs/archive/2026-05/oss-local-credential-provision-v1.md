## Summary

The license-boundary refactor cut one notch too deep. Removing the hosted OAuth
brokerage from OSS was right; removing the local credential *establishment* path
was not. Today the MIT CLI cannot supply a credential to a skill: `runx connect`
refuses and points at the private distribution, the runtime's scoped env is a
non-secret allowlist, the CLI run path never constructs a `MaterialResolver`,
and there is no token-intake verb. So the open runtime cannot do authenticated
work standalone, which breaks the doctrine's offline/zero-dependency promise and
north-star's "BYO credential delivery unlocks the portfolio" order, for no moat
gain (the brokerage secrets were always in `cloud/packages/auth`).

This spec restores a local, no-network credential-provision path: a one-shot,
per-run structured credential descriptor that the runtime turns into a
`CredentialDelivery` through the existing opaque `MaterialResolver`, with the
secret redacted. v1 persists no secret state and does not change the
credential-delivery contract schema, so labeling the receipt `grant_type: local`
is deferred to a coordinated contract migration. It does not reopen OAuth
brokerage, Nango, hosted connect, or secret custody.

## Context

- `crates/runx-cli/src/main.rs:44` returns "runx connect is not available in the
  MIT OSS CLI; use the hosted/private CLI distribution".
- `crates/runx-runtime/src/execution/runner.rs:48` defines `safe_default_env()`,
  a strict allowlist (`PATH`, `SystemRoot`, `PATHEXT`, `RUNX_RECEIPT_DIR`,
  `RUNX_PROJECT_DIR`, `RUNX_CWD`) with no secret passthrough.
- `crates/runx-runtime/src/credentials.rs:106` defines `MaterialResolver` and
  `InMemoryMaterialResolver`, populated only programmatically; the CLI run path
  does not construct one (`rg MaterialResolver crates/runx-cli/src` is empty).
- The doctrine ("runs stay local, zero-dependency") and `plans/runx.md` "Offline
  mode: `runx connect --token`, no browser, `grant_type: local`" both assume a
  local establishment path that no longer exists in OSS.
- `connect-auth-mit-boundary-v1` (archived) banned `NangoConnection`, `oauth_*`,
  `RUNX_CONNECT_*` and kept the opaque `MaterialResolver`. That stays.

## Objectives

- Add a one-shot, per-run local credential-provision surface to the OSS CLI,
  pinned exactly in "V1 Provision Contract" below: a single credential per run
  supplied through `--credential` (non-secret binding metadata) plus
  `--secret-env` (the env var name and the secret value). No persisted secret
  state, no local config file.
- Carry the descriptor on `SkillRunRequest`; the runtime, not the CLI, derives the
  `CredentialEnvelope`, `CredentialDeliveryProfile`, and a local allow decision for
  that descriptor and constructs `CredentialDelivery`, keeping policy and redaction
  centralized.
- Deliver the secret to the adapter through the existing `CredentialDelivery`
  channel, redacted across receipts, output, and metadata.
- Defer `grant_type: local` receipt labeling: v1 records local provision through
  the existing `CredentialDeliveryObservation` metadata only and adds no contract
  schema field (that is a coordinated migration, see Scope).
- Keep the boundary intact: no OAuth brokerage, Nango, hosted calls, or custody.
  Add only the local-provision identifiers to the boundary manifest allowlist;
  reintroduce none of the banned brokerage identifiers.

## V1 Provision Contract

The v1 surface is exactly two `runx skill` flags, used together, for a single
credential per run. There is no persisted state and no config file.

- `--credential <provider>:<auth_mode>:<material_ref>[:<scope,scope,...>]`
  carries non-secret binding metadata. `provider`, `auth_mode`, and
  `material_ref` are required and non-empty; the optional fourth segment is a
  comma-separated scope list (blank scopes are dropped). It carries no secret.
- `--secret-env <ENV_VAR>=<value>` names the environment variable the secret is
  delivered into for the skill process and carries the secret value itself
  (split on the first `=`; both the env var name and the secret value must be
  non-empty, matching the runtime's empty-material rejection).

Precedence and shape: one credential per run; a repeated flag takes its last
occurrence. The two flags are interdependent.

Validation failures (each a non-zero CLI error with no run started):
- `--credential` missing any of provider/auth_mode/material_ref.
- `--secret-env` without `=`, with an empty env var name, or with an empty
  (whitespace-only) secret value.
- `--credential` without `--secret-env`, or `--secret-env` without
  `--credential`. Neither flag present provisions no credential.

Runtime derivation (ownership boundary): the CLI only parses these flags into a
`LocalCredentialDescriptor` and forwards it on the run request. The runtime, not
the CLI, derives the `CredentialEnvelope`, `CredentialDeliveryProfile`, and the
local allow decision, and constructs `CredentialDelivery` through the existing
`from_allowed_binding` seam, so policy and redaction stay centralized. The
secret is held only for the run's lifetime.

Known v1 limitation: because `--secret-env` carries the value as a command-line
argument, the secret is visible in the process argument list while the run is
live. v1 accepts this for the one-shot local path; a stdin or env-passthrough
secret channel is a later hardening, not v1.

## Scope

In scope:
- `crates/runx-cli/src` (the per-run `--secret-env`/`--credential` provision flags;
  forward the descriptor to the runtime).
- `crates/runx-runtime/src` (carry the descriptor on `SkillRunRequest`; derive the
  envelope/profile/allow-decision and construct `CredentialDelivery` in the run
  path; reuse the existing `MaterialResolver` and redaction).
- `docs/license-boundary.manifest.json` allowlist update.
- Tests: an offline run that consumes a per-run provided credential; redaction
  across receipts/output/metadata; a no-network assertion (sibling to `locality.rs`).

Out of scope:
- OAuth brokerage, hosted connect, Nango, or secret custody (stay private).
- Any credential-delivery contract schema change, including a `grant_type` field
  (deferred; coordinate with `credential-envelope-opaque-reference-v1`).
- Persistent local secret storage of any kind (v1 is per-run, in-memory only).
- Browser loopback/PKCE establishment (a possible later add, not v1).
- Any cloud change.

## Acceptance

- [ ] `dod1` The OSS CLI can provide a credential for a single run via the
  structured per-run descriptor, with no network, no hosted dependency, and no
  secret persisted to disk.
- [ ] `dod2` A skill consuming that credential runs, and the secret is redacted
  from receipts, captured output, and metadata via `CredentialDelivery`.
- [ ] `dod3` The license-boundary guard passes; only local-provision identifiers
  are added to the allowlist and no banned brokerage identifier is reintroduced.
- [ ] `dod4` A no-network test proves the provision + run path makes no outbound
  calls.
- [ ] `dod5` No credential-delivery contract schema field is added; local
  provision is observable only through existing non-secret observation metadata.

Validation:
- [ ] `v1` Scafld validates this spec.
  - Command: `scafld validate oss-local-credential-provision-v1 --json`
  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Status: pending
- [ ] `v2` Offline credential-provision run + redaction tests pass.
  - Command: `cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p runx-cli -p runx-runtime local_credential`
  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Status: pending
  - Note: `runx-cli` enables the runtime `cli-tool` and `mcp` features the
    credential-delivery tests are gated on; keep the `-p runx-cli -p runx-runtime`
    pair, or pass `--features runx-runtime/cli-tool,runx-runtime/mcp` if narrowed.
- [ ] `v3` The license-boundary guard passes on the changed tree.
  - Command: `cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p runx-runtime --test license_boundary`
  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Status: pending
- [ ] `v4` The CLI locality guard still passes.
  - Command: `cargo test --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p runx-cli --test locality`
  - Expected kind: `exit_code_zero`
  - Status: pending

## Rollback

Revert the CLI surface and run-path wiring; remove the allowlist additions. The
offline path returns to its current absent state with no secret material
persisted. The boundary guard must still pass after rollback.

## Origin

Conversation on 2026-05-22: grounded code review showed the MIT CLI cannot
provide a credential at all after the boundary refactor, contradicting the
project's own doctrine and north-star order. The fix is additive (restore local
establishment), not an unwind of the boundary.

## Harden Rounds

### round-1

Status: needs_revision
Started: 2026-05-22T02:10:29Z
Ended: 2026-05-22T02:10:29Z
Verdict: needs_revision
Provider: codex
Output format: codex.output_file
Summary: Verdict: needs revision. The direction is architecturally right, but approval is unsafe until the spec pins the v1 CLI surface, the local descriptor-to-delivery derivation, the CLI/runtime ownership boundary, and the sealed location for `grant_type: local`. Also fix the manifest path and make rollback match the persistence choice.

Checks:
- path audit
  - Grounded in: rg --files from /Users/kam/dev/runx/runx/oss; docs/license-boundary.manifest.json:1
  - Result: failed
  - Evidence: Declared paths exist for `crates/runx-cli/src`, `crates/runx-runtime/src`, and `crates/runx-cli/tests/locality.rs`; the actual manifest is `docs/license-boundary.manifest.json`, while the draft scope says `oss/docs/license-boundary.manifest.json`.
- command audit
  - Grounded in: command output
  - Result: passed
  - Evidence: `command -v scafld` returned `/opt/homebrew/bin/scafld`; `scafld status oss-local-credential-provision-v1 --json` returned ok/status draft/gate harden; `scafld validate oss-local-credential-provision-v1 --json` returned valid=true. `./bin/scafld` is absent, but the draft validation commands use `scafld`, not `./bin/scafld`.
- scope/migration audit
  - Grounded in: code:crates/runx-contracts/src/credential_delivery.rs:118; code:crates/runx-runtime/src/credentials.rs:222
  - Result: failed
  - Evidence: `CredentialDeliveryObservation` has no `grant_type` field, and the draft does not include `crates/runx-contracts` or `schemas/credential-delivery-*.json` in scope. `CredentialDelivery::from_allowed_binding` requires a `CredentialBindingDecision`, `CredentialEnvelope`, `CredentialDeliveryProfile`, and `MaterialResolver`, but the draft does not specify how local provision creates or derives the non-secret envelope/profile/binding inputs.
- acceptance timing audit
  - Grounded in: command output; code:crates/runx-cli/Cargo.toml:20; code:crates/runx-runtime/tests/credential_delivery.rs:1
  - Result: passed
  - Evidence: `scafld validate ... --json` passes. The cargo acceptance command could not be executed in this read-only sandbox because Cargo failed to open `crates/target/debug/.cargo-lock`; source review shows `runx-cli` enables runtime `cli-tool` and `mcp` features, so the planned package combination can compile feature-gated credential tests once a writable target dir is available.
- rollback/repair audit
  - Grounded in: spec_gap:Rollback
  - Result: failed
  - Evidence: Rollback says no secret material is persisted, but the objective explicitly leaves local config file as an acceptable implementation option. If the build chooses a persistent file, rollback must include deletion/repair of that local material or the no-persistence statement becomes false.
- design challenge
  - Grounded in: code:crates/runx-runtime/src/adapters/cli_tool.rs:58; code:crates/runx-runtime/src/adapters/external_adapter.rs:787; code:crates/runx-runtime/src/execution/skill_run.rs:192; code:crates/runx-runtime/src/execution/runner/steps.rs:74
  - Result: failed
  - Evidence: Existing adapter delivery/redaction is the right seam: `CliToolAdapter` injects `credential_delivery.secret_env()` after `env_clear()` and redacts captured output; external adapter process env does the same. However, the native skill and graph execution paths currently set `CredentialDelivery::none()`, so the spec must define exactly where local provision is converted into delivery.

Issues:
- [medium/blocks approval] `H1` path audit - Boundary manifest path is wrong relative to the checkout.
  - Status: open
  - Grounded in: rg --files from /Users/kam/dev/runx/runx/oss
  - Evidence: The draft scope says `oss/docs/license-boundary.manifest.json`, but from the task checkout `/Users/kam/dev/runx/runx/oss` the existing file is `docs/license-boundary.manifest.json`.
  - Recommendation: Correct the spec scope to `docs/license-boundary.manifest.json` so execution does not target a nonexistent nested `oss/docs` path.
  - Question: Which boundary manifest path is authoritative for this task?
  - Recommended answer: Use `docs/license-boundary.manifest.json` relative to the OSS repo root.
  - If unanswered: Default to `docs/license-boundary.manifest.json` relative to `/Users/kam/dev/runx/runx/oss`.
- [high/blocks approval] `H2` scope/migration audit - `grant_type: local` is required but has no specified sealed schema location.
  - Status: open
  - Grounded in: code:crates/runx-contracts/src/credential_delivery.rs:118
  - Evidence: `CredentialDeliveryObservation` contains schema/status/refs/profile/provider/purpose/delivery_mode/material_ref_hash/roles/redaction refs/observed_at, but no `grant_type` field. Receipt sealing builds acts/seals from `SkillOutput`, and the draft does not name where `grant_type: local` belongs.
  - Recommendation: Define the wire/receipt location. If it requires schema changes, add `crates/runx-contracts`, schema JSON, and fixture updates to scope and call out the public API change.
  - Question: Where exactly should `grant_type: local` be sealed, and is changing the credential-delivery contract schema in scope?
  - Recommended answer: Seal it through an explicit credential-delivery observation/schema update and expand scope to `crates/runx-contracts` plus `schemas/credential-delivery-*.json` fixtures.
  - If unanswered: Default to adding no schema field until a public contract migration is explicitly approved; record local grant type only in a named existing non-secret metadata field if that is accepted.
- [high/blocks approval] `H3` scope/migration audit - The spec does not define the non-secret credential metadata required by the existing delivery contract.
  - Status: open
  - Grounded in: code:crates/runx-runtime/src/credentials.rs:222
  - Evidence: `CredentialDelivery::from_allowed_binding` requires `CredentialBindingDecision`, `CredentialEnvelope`, `CredentialDeliveryProfile`, and a resolver. The draft only says to supply a token/secret and populate `MaterialResolver`; it does not specify how local provision creates or selects the envelope, profile, provider, auth mode, env binding, scopes, or allow decision.
  - Recommendation: Add the concrete input shape and derivation rules before approval; a raw `--secret` alone is insufficient for the existing delivery API.
  - Question: What is the exact local credential descriptor that turns a raw secret into a `CredentialEnvelope`, delivery profile, and allowed binding decision?
  - Recommended answer: Use a structured per-run descriptor: provider, auth_mode, env_var, grant_id/material_ref, scopes, and secret value; runtime declares an allow decision only for that local descriptor and profile match.
  - If unanswered: Default to requiring a structured CLI provision payload containing provider, auth_mode, env_var, material_ref/grant_id, and scopes, with runtime deriving the local allow decision.
- [high/blocks approval] `H4` scope/migration audit - Credential delivery ownership at the CLI/runtime boundary is undefined.
  - Status: open
  - Grounded in: code:crates/runx-runtime/src/execution/orchestrator.rs:18; code:crates/runx-runtime/src/execution/skill_run.rs:192; code:crates/runx-cli/src/skill.rs:11
  - Evidence: `SkillRunRequest` only carries skill_path, receipt_dir, run_id, answers_path, inputs, env, and cwd. `runner_invocation` always sets `credential_delivery: CredentialDelivery::none()`. The CLI `SkillPlan` has no credential fields and forwards only env/cwd/inputs.
  - Recommendation: Choose the ownership boundary. Runtime-side construction better preserves policy/redaction ownership; CLI-side construction makes the CLI own credential semantics.
  - Question: Should local credential provision be part of `SkillRunRequest`, or should the CLI precompute a `CredentialDelivery` before invoking `LocalOrchestrator`?
  - Recommended answer: Make `SkillRunRequest` carry a structured local credential provision request; runtime constructs `CredentialDelivery` and keeps policy/redaction centralized.
  - If unanswered: Default to adding structured local credential provision to `SkillRunRequest` and constructing `CredentialDelivery` inside runtime before adapter invocation.
- [high/blocks approval] `H5` design challenge - The provision UX is still a design menu, not an executable contract.
  - Status: open
  - Grounded in: spec_gap:Objectives
  - Evidence: The draft objective lists multiple possible UX surfaces (`runx grant`/`--secret`, local config file, env allowlist), and Phase 1 defers exact UX/wire design to build time. That leaves approved execution free to choose incompatible persistence, parsing, and rollback behavior.
  - Recommendation: Pick exactly one v1 surface in the spec and define its flags/file shape, precedence, validation failures, and redaction expectations.
  - Question: What is the v1 CLI surface: one-shot per-run secret, a `runx grant` command, a local config file, or env allowlist?
  - Recommended answer: Use one-shot per-run credential provision only; do not add persistent local config in v1.
  - If unanswered: Default to a per-run `runx skill ... --credential <descriptor>`/`--secret-env <ENV=...>` style surface with no persisted secret state.
- [medium/blocks approval] `H6` rollback/repair audit - Rollback is incompatible with the draft's local config file option.
  - Status: open
  - Grounded in: spec_gap:Rollback
  - Evidence: Rollback says reverting the CLI surface/wiring leaves no secret material persisted, but the objectives allow a local config file. A persistent implementation would need an explicit repair command/path cleanup.
  - Recommendation: Either forbid persistence for v1 or add exact storage path, file permissions, cleanup command, and rollback verification.
  - Question: Is v1 allowed to persist secret material locally, and if so what command/path removes it during rollback or repair?
  - Recommended answer: Forbid secret persistence in v1; accept only per-run in-memory material sourced from CLI/env.
  - If unanswered: Default to no persistent local secret storage in v1; rollback only removes code and allowlist additions.
- [low/advisory] `H7` acceptance timing audit - Validation feature activation is implicit but probably workable.
  - Status: open
  - Grounded in: code:crates/runx-cli/Cargo.toml:20; code:crates/runx-runtime/Cargo.toml:18; code:crates/runx-runtime/tests/credential_delivery.rs:1
  - Evidence: `runx-cli` enables runtime features `cli-tool` and `mcp`, while `runx-runtime` default features are empty and credential-delivery tests are gated with `cfg(all(feature = "cli-tool", feature = "mcp"))`. The planned package command likely enables the right runtime features through `runx-cli`, but the spec should avoid relying on implicit feature unification if the test moves to runtime-only invocation.
  - Recommendation: Clarify the feature expectation in validation notes; this is advisory because the current package pair appears to unify the needed features.
  - Question: Should the local credential test command explicitly name runtime features, or intentionally rely on `runx-cli` enabling them?
  - Recommended answer: Keep `-p runx-cli -p runx-runtime` and note that `runx-cli` enables runtime `cli-tool,mcp`; add explicit features if the command is changed.
  - If unanswered: Keep the current package pair or add explicit `--features runx-runtime/cli-tool,runx-runtime/mcp` if the command is narrowed.


## Review

Status: completed
Verdict: pass
Mode: discover
Provider: claude:claude-opus-4-7
Output: claude.mcp_submit_review
Summary: The OSS local credential-provision path is functionally restored end-to-end. The CLI parses `--credential`/`--secret-env` per the V1 Provision Contract, the descriptor rides on `SkillRunRequest`, the runtime derives `CredentialDelivery` via the existing `from_allowed_binding` seam, and `CliToolAdapter` injects the secret env after `env_clear()` and redacts captured output. The license-boundary allowlist update is narrow (only `connection_id` for the local envelope) and no banned brokerage identifier is reintroduced. Two soft gaps remain: the local-provision path leaves `CredentialDeliveryObservation` unset (the spec Objective/dod5 say v1 should record local provision through that existing metadata) and the CLI accepts an empty `--secret-env` value but the runtime rejects it at `apply_profile`. Some in-scope-path files (`payment/state.rs`, `payment/supervisor.rs`, `receipts/seal.rs`, `execution/runner/{authority,steps}.rs`) carry unrelated kernel work; the commit message labels this an explicit checkpoint, but it widens the diff beyond the credential-provision change.

Attack log:
- `crates/runx-cli/src/skill.rs`: V1 Provision Contract parsing: provider/auth_mode/material_ref required, scope list optional, interdependent flags, repeated-flag-last-wins -> clean (parse_credential_binding splits on ':' splitn(4,) with empty-segment rejection; finalize_local_credential errors on either flag alone; state overwrite on repeat.)
- `docs/license-boundary.manifest.json`: Allowlist additions limited to local-provision identifiers; no banned brokerage identifier reintroduced -> clean (Only crates/runx-runtime/src/credentials.rs:connection_id added to allowlist with rationale about local envelope construction; banned list intact.)
- `crates/runx-runtime/src/credentials.rs + adapters/cli_tool.rs`: Redaction trace: secret -> SecretEnv -> envs() -> stdout capture -> redact_bytes_to_string -> SkillOutput -> seal -> clean (secret_env values feed envs after env_clear; redact_text replaces all secret values in captured bytes before SkillOutput is constructed.)
- `crates/runx-runtime/src/credentials.rs:from_local_descriptor`: Spec dod5/Objective: observation metadata recorded for local provision -> finding (F1: from_local_descriptor never sets public_observation; CliToolAdapter never writes observation metadata.)
- `crates/runx-cli/src/skill.rs + credentials.rs:apply_profile`: Edge case: empty --secret-env value -> finding (F2: CLI accepts empty value; runtime rejects with EmptyMaterial; spec says value may be empty.)
- `crates/runx-runtime/src`: Scope drift: changes inside the declared path but unrelated to credential provision -> finding (F3: payment_state, payment_supervisor, receipts/seal, execution/runner/authority+steps modified with zero credential references; commit message acknowledges as checkpoint of in-progress kernel work.)
- `crates/runx-runtime/src/adapters/cli_tool.rs:spawn_cli_tool_process`: Host env leak: process inherits host secrets via sandbox env_allowlist or env::vars passthrough -> clean (envs are env_cleared and rebuilt from sandbox.env (host allowlist) then overlaid with credential_delivery.secret_env, so explicit provision overrides any host-supplied value.)
- `crates/runx-cli/tests/local_credential.rs + tests/locality.rs`: dod4: provision + run path makes no outbound calls -> clean (locality.rs asserts runx-cli has no HTTP client deps and runtime network is opt-in; local_credential.rs env_clears and only spawns sh — no network surface is reachable.)
- `crates/runx-cli/src/skill.rs:parse_secret_env`: Argument injection: --secret-env containing '=' in the value -> clean (split_once('=') correctly partitions on the first '=' so values may contain additional '=' characters.)
- `crates/runx-runtime/src/credentials.rs:from_local_descriptor`: CredentialEnvelope construction: legacy connection_id wiring -> clean (connection_id set to None; matches manifest allowlist rationale; no provider-specific construction.)
- `crates/runx-runtime/src/execution/skill_run.rs:runner_invocation`: Credential propagation: descriptor -> CredentialDelivery on SkillInvocation for agent and cli-tool runners -> clean (All three supported runner source_types (agent, agent-step, cli-tool) receive the constructed CredentialDelivery; None descriptor falls back to CredentialDelivery::none().)
- `crates/runx-cli/tests/launcher.rs`: Test coverage: launcher routes --credential and --secret-env into SkillPlan.local_credential -> clean (Existing skill route test threads local_credential: None through the SkillPlan struct; no dedicated round-trip test for the new flags but skill.rs parser is exercised by tests/local_credential.rs.)

Findings:
- [medium/non-blocking] `F1` Local credential provision is not recorded in any CredentialDeliveryObservation, so receipts have no auditable trace that a credential was used.
  - Location: `crates/runx-runtime/src/credentials.rs:263`
  - Evidence: crates/runx-runtime/src/credentials.rs:230-264 — from_local_descriptor returns from from_allowed_binding, which leaves public_observation: None (line 288). CliToolAdapter never reads public_observation or writes credential observation metadata (crates/runx-runtime/src/adapters/cli_tool.rs:27-51), unlike external_adapter.rs which has add_credential_delivery_metadata. Result: the sealed receipt contains zero non-secret evidence that a credential was provisioned for the run.
  - Impact: Spec Objective: 'v1 records local provision through the existing CredentialDeliveryObservation metadata only' and dod5: 'local provision is observable only through existing non-secret observation metadata' are not met for the cli-tool path. Auditors cannot tell from a receipt that a local credential was bound to the run; only that the captured output was redacted.
  - Validation: Extend tests/local_credential_provision.rs (or the CLI sibling test) to assert the sealed receipt or skill output metadata exposes a non-secret CredentialDeliveryObservation referencing the descriptor's provider/auth_mode/material_ref.
- [low/non-blocking] `F2` CLI parser accepts an empty --secret-env value, but the runtime rejects empty secrets with EmptyMaterial, so the spec's 'value may be empty' parses cleanly only to fail mid-run.
  - Location: `crates/runx-runtime/src/credentials.rs:392`
  - Evidence: crates/runx-cli/src/skill.rs:117-125 parses --secret-env GITHUB_TOKEN= as ('GITHUB_TOKEN', '') without error. crates/runx-runtime/src/credentials.rs:392-396 in apply_profile rejects with CredentialDeliveryError::EmptyMaterial when secret.expose().trim().is_empty(). The spec V1 Provision Contract states 'the value may be empty', and 'validation failures (each a non-zero CLI error with no run started)' does not list empty value, so the user gets a delayed runtime error instead of a clean CLI rejection.
  - Impact: Surprising failure mode: a user-typed empty value passes CLI validation, opens a run, then fails inside the runtime. Either CLI parsing should reject the empty value, or apply_profile should accept it (consistent with the spec's permissive intent).
  - Validation: Add a CLI parse test that asserts --secret-env NAME= either errors at parse time or runs to completion deliberately, matching the chosen contract.
- [low/non-blocking] `F3` In-progress kernel work is bundled into the credential-provision task: payment/state.rs, payment/supervisor.rs, receipts/seal.rs, execution/runner/authority.rs, and execution/runner/steps.rs are modified with no relationship to credential provision.
  - Location: `crates/runx-runtime/src/payment/supervisor.rs`
  - Evidence: Task Changes Since Approval Baseline lists modifications to crates/runx-runtime/src/payment/state.rs, payment/supervisor.rs, receipts/seal.rs, execution/runner/authority.rs, and execution/runner/steps.rs. Grepping these files for local_credential|LocalCredentialDescriptor|from_local_descriptor returns zero hits. The latest commit message (019f807) describes the change as 'feat(runtime): restore local credential provision; checkpoint in-progress kernel work' — it acknowledges bundling unrelated work.
  - Impact: Widens the review surface beyond declared task scope (credential provision), making regressions in payment/kernel paths harder to attribute and re-review. AGENTS.md 'Do Not: Edit outside declared scope, objectives, or invariants.' is technically observed at the path level (crates/runx-runtime/src) but violated at the objective level.
  - Validation: Re-run the diff against the approval baseline restricted to credential-relevant files and confirm the kernel/payment files are not part of this task's PR.
