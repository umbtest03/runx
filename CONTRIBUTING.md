# Contributing to runx

Thanks for considering a contribution. This document covers the contribution
workflow and the sign-off required on every commit.

## Licensing

runx is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. By contributing, you
agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license. See
[LICENSE](./LICENSE) for the full text.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

All commits to this repository must be signed off under the
[Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/). The DCO
is a lightweight affirmation that you have the right to submit the contribution
under the project's license. There is no separate CLA to sign.

Sign off on every commit by adding a `Signed-off-by:` trailer. The easiest way
is to pass `-s` to `git commit`:

```
git commit -s -m "your commit message"
```

This appends a trailer that looks like:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

The name and email must match the real identity you wish to be associated
with the contribution. Pseudonymous sign-offs are not accepted.

The full DCO text (reproduced here for reference):

> By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:
>
> (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the
>     right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file;
>     or
>
> (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my
>     knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I
>     have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications,
>     whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source
>     license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as
>     indicated in the file; or
>
> (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who
>     certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.
>
> (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public
>     and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information

## Contribution workflow

1. Open an issue describing the change before sending a PR for anything
   non-trivial. Small fixes can go straight to a PR.
2. Fork the repo and create a topic branch from `main`.
3. Make your change. Keep commits focused and conventional (`feat:`, `fix:`,
   `docs:`, `chore:`, etc.).
4. Run the workspace checks locally:
   - `pnpm install`
   - `pnpm build`
   - `pnpm typecheck`
   - `pnpm test`
5. Sign off your commits with `git commit -s` (see DCO above).
6. Open a pull request against `main` with a clear description of the change
   and any test or validation evidence.

## Development setup

Use Node.js 20 or newer and pnpm 10 or newer. From the OSS workspace:

```bash
cd oss
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

For a type-only check:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

For the fast local loop:

```bash
pnpm test:fast
```

For Rust kernel parity work, run:

```bash
pnpm rust:check
```

This is blocking evidence for Rust-owned kernel and contract surfaces. The
command uses `cargo-deny` and `cargo-public-api`; if they are missing, install
them with:

```bash
cargo install cargo-deny cargo-public-api
rustup toolchain install nightly --profile minimal
```

`test:fast` uses `vitest.fast.config.ts` and is intended for package-adjacent
iteration. `pnpm test` remains the full workspace suite and includes the
isolated CLI package contract check.

See [docs/how-we-test.md](docs/how-we-test.md) for the full test lane split,
including the `RUNX_VITEST_BATCH=cli-package` batch.

To run one test file:

```bash
pnpm vitest run tests/examples/hello-world.test.ts
```

To use the local CLI from any directory:

```bash
pnpm cli:link-global
runx --help
```

Re-run `pnpm build` after source changes that affect compiled package output.

## Skill authoring paths

Use `runx new <name>` when you already have the runx CLI available locally and
want a standalone skill package:

```bash
runx new docs-demo
```

Use `npm create @runxhq/skill@latest <name>` for a cold start from npm:

```bash
npm create @runxhq/skill@latest docs-demo
```

Both entry points go through the same scaffolder. Community skills should be
authored as standalone packages; the runx repo itself is the first-party lane
for official skills, runtime code, tests, and examples.

The first runnable example is documented in
[docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md). The generated package
export index is in [docs/api-surface.md](docs/api-surface.md).

## Releasing

The CLI ships from a single `cli-vX.Y.Z` tag to every channel (GitHub Release,
npm, crates.io, Homebrew, Scoop, winget, AUR, Docker) plus the `runx.ai/install`
one-liner. The tag is the only source of truth; release jobs stamp the version,
they are never hand-committed. Full pipeline, versioning model, required secrets,
and how to cut a release are in [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md).

## Code of conduct

Be respectful. Assume good faith. Disagreement on technical direction is
welcome; personal attacks are not.

## Reporting security issues

Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities. Email the maintainers
privately instead. Once a fix is ready, the issue and fix can be disclosed
publicly.
