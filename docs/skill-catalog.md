# Skill catalog and discovery

The runx catalog has two jobs:

- help operators find a skill they can run now;
- help contributors avoid opening a duplicate skill PR or publishing a package
  into the wrong category.

The live registry is the source of truth for published community and verified
packages. This page is the maintainer-curated map: it explains how to search,
which category slugs are canonical, and what evidence a new skill proposal must
include before it belongs in the runx repo.

## Where to look first

Use the public catalog when you want to browse or share a package:

```text
https://runx.ai/x
https://runx.ai/x?category=security
https://runx.ai/x/<owner>/<skill>@<version>
```

Use the CLI when you are preparing work or checking for overlap:

```bash
runx registry search "cve audit" --registry https://api.runx.ai --json
runx registry read runx/cve-audit@sha-e11c90bbeb16 --registry https://api.runx.ai --json
runx add runx/cve-audit@sha-e11c90bbeb16 --registry https://api.runx.ai
runx skill runx/cve-audit@sha-e11c90bbeb16 --registry https://api.runx.ai --json
```

The command shape is deliberate:

| Need | Command or URL |
| --- | --- |
| Browse the catalog | `https://runx.ai/x` |
| Browse one category | `https://runx.ai/x?category=<slug>` |
| Search from a terminal | `runx registry search <query>` |
| Inspect one package | `runx registry read <owner>/<name>@<version>` |
| Install package material | `runx add <owner>/<name>@<version>` |
| Execute a local or registry skill | `runx skill <path-or-ref>` |

Do not combine the install and execution verbs. Installation is `runx add`;
execution is `runx skill`.

## Naming a skill

Name a skill so an agent instinctively reaches for the right one:

- Name the **job**, not the mechanism. Drop `-auditor`, `-generator`,
  `-analyst`, `-pipeline` suffixes.
- One distinct **verb per pipeline layer** so sibling skills never blur. The
  security trio is the model: `cve-audit` (detect, deterministic) ->
  `vuln-triage` (assess, agent) -> `vuln-disclosure` (publish, governed).
- Keep provider rails and integrations descriptive (`stripe-pay`, `web-fetch`).
- Retrieval beats cleverness: the searchable term wins, and keywords the name
  drops go in the `description`.

Renaming an existing skill is a `git mv`, a token sweep, and a regenerate
(`packet-schemas`, `official-lock`) plus `verify:fast` and the harness. For a
maintained `runx/*` skill the hosted registry row is preserved (its
`created_at` and version history carry across) during the operator deploy, so a
rename never resets the row.

## Canonical category slugs

Registry categories are maintained by runx, not invented per package. A skill
author may request a category with `runx.category` in `SKILL.md` or the execution
profile, but the hosted registry owns the final facet shown on `runx.ai/x`.

| Slug | Label | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `code` | CODE | Software lifecycle: implement, review, release, refactor, and repo evolution. |
| `payments` | PAYMENTS | Money movement: charge, refund, settlement, dispute, and billing rails. |
| `data` | DATA | Pipelines, querying, enrichment, analytics, and extraction. |
| `research` | RESEARCH | Bounded investigation and synthesis: briefs, market and ecosystem analysis. |
| `content` | CONTENT | Creation and publishing: drafts, documentation, posts, and marketing copy. |
| `security` | SECURITY | Risk and trust: vulnerability scans, advisories, audits, and compliance. |
| `ops` | OPS | Running systems: deploy, monitor, incident, infra, triage, and intake. |
| `growth` | GROWTH | Go-to-market: sales, outreach, CRM, SEO, and campaigns. |
| `authoring` | AUTHORING | Skill building: design, harness, evaluation, improvement, and registry trust. |

`authoring` is a builder-surface category. It is reachable in the catalog and
API, but buyer-facing homepage rows can omit it to keep product discovery
focused on executable business domains.

## First-party skill map

The first-party map is intentionally smaller than the live catalog. It lists
skills the runx repo maintains directly, not every community package. Community
packages should be discovered through the live registry and promoted by
evidence, not copied into the repo by default.

| Category | Maintained packages |
| --- | --- |
| `authoring` | `design-skill`, `evolve`, `improve-skill`, `overlay`, `policy-author`, `review-receipt`, `skill-lab`, `skill-testing` |
| `code` | `release` |
| `content` | `brand-voice`, `content-pipeline`, `ghostwrite`, `moltbook` |
| `data` | `data-store`, `run-history`, `sql-analyst` |
| `growth` | `lead-enrichment`, `lead-router`, `nitrosend` |
| `ops` | `github-sync`, `governed-outbound`, `chief-of-staff`, `issue-intake`, `issue-triage`, `messageboard`, `n8n-handoff`, `ops-desk`, `send-as`, `zapier-handoff` |
| `payments` | `charge`, `dispute-respond`, `mock-pay`, `mock-refund`, `mpp-pay`, `mpp-refund`, `refund`, `settle-invoice`, `spend`, `stripe-pay`, `stripe-refund`, `x402-pay` |
| `research` | `ecosystem-brief`, `research` |
| `security` | `cve-audit`, `vuln-triage`, `vuln-disclosure`, `least-privilege`, `audit-receipt`, `redact-pii`, `sandbox-harden`, `sign-receipt`, `vault-unseal` |

Graph stages, harness fixtures, context-only packages, and provider bindings are
not listed here unless they are meant to be run as catalog packages. Their
ownership lives with the parent skill or binding metadata.

## Duplicate check before opening a skill PR

Before opening a new first-party skill PR, do the overlap check in public:

1. Search the live catalog by name, category, and capability words.
2. Read the closest first-party and verified community packages.
3. Search open PRs and issues for the same category and runner shape.
4. Decide whether the work is a new skill, an improvement to an existing skill,
   a graph composition, or a community package that does not belong in the
   first-party repo.
5. Put that reasoning in the PR body.

Useful commands:

```bash
runx registry search "<capability>" --registry https://api.runx.ai --json
gh pr list --repo runxhq/runx --search "<capability> OR <category>" --state open
gh issue list --repo runxhq/runx --search "<capability> OR <category>" --state open
```

A strong proposal answers:

- What pain does this skill solve that the current catalog does not?
- Which existing packages did you compare against?
- Why is this a new first-party package rather than a community registry
  package, graph composition, or patch to an existing skill?
- What runner files, `SKILL.md`, `X.yaml`, fixtures, harness evidence, receipt,
  and public registry URL prove it works?
- What authority, network, filesystem, provider, or spend boundaries does the
  execution profile declare?

Do not bundle unrelated CLI, runtime, docs, or release changes into a skill PR.
A first-party skill PR should be narrow enough that a maintainer can review the
package, harness, and evidence without separating it from repo history.

## When a community package is enough

Most new skills should start outside the first-party repo:

```bash
runx new <skill-name>
runx harness ./<skill-name> --json
runx login --for publish
runx registry publish ./<skill-name>/SKILL.md --registry https://api.runx.ai
```

That gives the package a durable URL, immutable digest, install path, and
publisher identity without making runx maintain it. Community packages can still
be used immediately:

```bash
runx add <owner>/<skill>@<version> --registry https://api.runx.ai
runx skill <owner>/<skill>@<version> --registry https://api.runx.ai --json
```

Promote a community skill toward first-party only when it has clear adoption,
verified runs, a stable execution profile, and a maintainership reason that
belongs in runx rather than in the publisher's own repo.

## Discovery contract for maintainers

When reviewing a skill PR, maintainers should check:

- the requested `runx.category` is one of the canonical slugs above;
- the public registry search does not already return a maintained equivalent;
- any overlap is explicitly explained in the PR body;
- the package contains only consumable skill material;
- `runx add` installs the same files that hosted publish validated;
- `runx skill` executes the package or fails closed with a useful receipt;
- public artifact URLs point to durable pages, not throwaway previews.

If a proposal is useful but not first-party, close the repo PR or issue with a
clear pointer to the live registry package and the evidence needed for future
promotion. That keeps the issue board clean without penalizing the contributor.
