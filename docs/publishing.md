# Publishing a skill to the runx registry

A runx skill is portable on its own, but to make it discoverable and installable
by others it has to be **published to a registry**. There are two registries, and
they behave differently.

## The two registries

- **Local workspace registry.** Lives under your workspace (`.runx`). No
  credentials. Use it to test the publish path and to resolve a skill locally
  before sharing it.
- **The hosted runx registry** (`runx.ai/x`). The shared, public, signed catalog.
  Publishing here is an authenticated write under *your* publisher identity, so it
  requires a publish credential.

## Before you publish

The skill must be real and runnable:

- A valid `SKILL.md` (frontmatter `name`, `description`, and `source`) and an
  `X.yaml` execution profile when the skill has a runnable path. Format:
  https://runx.ai/SKILL.md
- It passes the harness:
  ```bash
  runx harness ./skills/<your-skill> --json
  ```

## Publish locally first

```bash
runx registry publish ./skills/<your-skill>/SKILL.md
```

This writes the skill into your local workspace registry. It takes no credentials
and is the fast way to confirm the package resolves and installs before you push
it to the shared catalog.

## Publish to the hosted registry

The hosted registry is open by default and conservative in discovery. A new
public package starts as a community row, is reachable by URL and exact search,
and earns broader ranking through identity, harness evidence, and hosted
verified runs.

For humans, start at https://runx.ai/x/publish. There are two publish lanes:

- **Public URL publish.** Paste a public repository URL. runx indexes every valid
  `SKILL.md`/`X.yaml` package it finds and leaves the source in the upstream repo.
  This is the fastest way to get a community listing into the catalog.
- **Authenticated CLI publish.** Use this for publisher-controlled releases. Sign
  in once, then publish the package directly from your local checkout. Hosted
  runx derives the owner from your connected identity, reconstructs the submitted
  package, reruns the publish harness, rejects failed cases, and starts the row
  at community trust.

The CLI form keeps the public API token out of command lines:

```bash
runx login --for publish
runx registry publish ./skills/<your-skill>/SKILL.md --registry https://api.runx.ai
```

For remote publishes the CLI sends a bounded skill package:

- `SKILL.md` is the portable skill contract and is sent as the primary document.
- `X.yaml`, when present, is the execution profile and is sent as the profile
  document.
- Package files are selected by a small allowlist that mirrors what runx can
  consume from a skill package:
  - root-level `.js` / `.mjs` runner files referenced by `X.yaml`;
  - nested `SKILL.md` / `X.yaml` files for graph stages, context skills, and
    local sub-skills called by the graph;
  - `references/**/*.md` advisory markdown;
  - `tools/**/manifest.json` plus minimal `tools/**/run.js` or `run.mjs`
    runtimes for local tool manifests.

Nothing else is package material. Fixtures, source trees, build output,
`node_modules`, assets, dotfiles, local registry state, repo metadata, and random
helper files are not uploaded. Secret-looking allowed file names such as `.env`,
`.npmrc`, credentials JSON, private keys, and certificate/key bundles still fail
the publish before any remote upload.

This lets hosted runx rerun the harness from the same consumed skill material
instead of trusting a client-supplied summary, while keeping local credentials,
fixtures, source trees, and build trash out of the registry. The local harness
still runs first for fast feedback.

`runx login --for publish` opens the hosted sign-in flow and stores a
purpose-scoped public API token in the encrypted local config at
`public.api_token`. The token can publish and report skills, but it cannot move
money, mutate hosted billing state, or operate unrelated hosted surfaces. Hosted
CLI commands use token precedence in this order: an explicit `--token` when the
command has one, then `RUNX_PUBLIC_API_TOKEN`, then the stored token from
`runx login`. `runx registry publish` uses the env or stored-token sources.

After a public URL publish, use the claim flow from the registry listing to prove
control of the source repo and move matching versions toward verified discovery.

### Why sign in?

Publishing writes a signed package into a shared public catalog under your
publisher identity. That is an authenticated write to an external authority, so
runx treats it like every other governed action, with no special-casing:

- The **connected identity** proves the publisher namespace. Hosted runx derives
  the owner from that identity; the request body cannot spoof it.
- The **public API token is stored encrypted locally** and masked by `runx config`.
  Use `runx login --for publish` for human publishing, or
  `RUNX_PUBLIC_API_TOKEN` for CI when you intentionally inject the same narrow
  credential.
- New publishes start as **community**. Verification and evidence promote
  discovery; publisher declaration alone never does.
- Hosted publishing is rate-limited per publisher identity. A noisy publisher
  cannot churn public versions indefinitely, even though the on-ramp stays open.
- Hosted publishing reruns the submitted package harness. Failed harness cases
  stop the write before a registry row is created.
- The registry row stores immutable `digest`, `profile_digest`, and
  `package_digest` values for the published package. `runx add` installs the
  same allowlisted package files that hosted runx validated. Signed run receipts
  and hosted verified-run evidence are separate signals recorded when the skill
  is executed.

## After you publish

- Your skill appears as a live registry row on your publisher profile at
  `runx.ai/x/<publisher>`.
- New publishes start at **community** trust tier. Promotion to **verified**
  requires claimed source identity, passing harnesses, and signing evidence
  (shown on the publisher trust panel).
- Community rows with no install or run evidence stay out of broad discovery by
  default, but they remain reachable by direct URL and exact-name search. Use
  `?include=unverified` when intentionally browsing the full frontier.
- `first_party`, `verified`, and established `community` rows appear in normal
  discovery; ranking prefers hosted verified-run evidence first, then trust tier,
  install evidence, and recency. A verified run is counted only from a sealed
  hosted-issued receipt that carries runx-written registry metadata for the
  skill/version. Publisher self-runs are excluded when the publisher id is known.
- Confirm it resolves:
  ```bash
  runx registry search <your-skill>
  runx registry read <publisher>/<skill>@<version> --json
  runx add <publisher>/<skill>            # the friendly install path
  ```
