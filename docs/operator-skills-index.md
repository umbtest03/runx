# Operator Skills Index

This page lists every operator-style skill that ships under `skills/`, grouped by lane, so new contributors can discover what already exists without grepping the directory tree.

For the project-skill **pattern** (how to author a new one, the dogfood contract, and the "Add A Project Operator Skill Only When" decision rule), see [docs/operator-skills.md](./operator-skills.md). For the registry search path and canonical category slugs, see [docs/skill-catalog.md](./skill-catalog.md).

## When to Add a New Operator Skill vs. Extending an Existing One

Refer to the ["Add A Project Operator Skill Only When"](./operator-skills.md) section in the operator-skills doc for the decision rule. In summary:

- **Add a new skill** when the work has a distinct lifecycle, its own evidence shape, or needs a separate trust boundary.
- **Extend an existing skill** when the new capability shares the same lifecycle phase, evidence type, and governance gate as an existing skill.
- **Mock lanes** (`mock-*`) should always be paired with their live counterpart — don't add a mock lane without a corresponding provider lane, and don't ship a provider lane without a deterministic mock.

## Mock vs. Live Lanes

Skills prefixed with `mock-` are deterministic test lanes that model the same payment graph as their live counterparts without touching real providers. They share the same receipt format and evidence structure. Use mock lanes for dogfooding, harness testing, and CI verification. Provider lanes (`stripe-*`, `mpp-*`, `x402-pay`) run against real or sandbox payment providers under governed spend caps.
