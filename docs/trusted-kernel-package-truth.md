# Trusted Kernel Package Truth

Status: accepted OSS addendum for the Rust parity track.

The repo-root `docs/trusted-kernel-package-truth.md` remains the broad package
authority document for the full runx repository. This OSS-local addendum
records the Rust parity boundary in the same docs tree as the Rust architecture
plan, so scafld specs that run from `oss/` have a stable local path.

## Rust Cutover Rule

TypeScript remains the source of truth only for trusted-kernel behavior that
has not crossed a named cutover boundary. Rust is now canonical for advertised
native local CLI behavior, graph execution, harness and dogfood execution,
receipt sealing and verification, policy and registry configuration, authority
admission, and payment authority. TypeScript packages may wrap those paths for
distribution or compatibility, but they do not own the local behavior.

Rust crates that are still in parity-only mode remain conformance evidence
until a separate cutover spec changes a consumer and passes the relevant gate.

Local Rust kernel parity is checked with `pnpm rust:check`, which runs Cargo
formatting, clippy, workspace tests, crate graph/style guards, `cargo-deny`,
and the `runx-core` public API snapshot. In CI this remains advisory during
Phase A; it becomes blocking only through the `rust-kernel-blocking-promotion`
spec after five clean kernel-touching PRs.

Kernel parity fixtures live under `fixtures/kernel/`. They are generated from
the TypeScript implementation and act as conformance evidence for the Rust
port. Fixture refreshes must be deliberate: update the TypeScript oracle,
regenerate the fixture JSON, and review the semantic diff before accepting a
Rust behavior change.

`crates/runx-core` currently provides Rust state-machine parity and Rust
policy parity against the checked-in fixture set. Rust policy is authoritative
where the native runtime or CLI uses it for local admission, authority, and
configuration decisions. Remaining TypeScript consumers keep their own sunset
specs; they should not be extended as a second source of truth for local
execution.

Policy executable-name normalization is host-independent for fixture parity:
backslashes are treated as path separators on every host. This keeps strict
CLI-tool inline-code admission consistent across POSIX and Windows runners;
for example, `C:\Tools\node.exe -e ...` normalizes to `node` and is denied
under the strict inline-code policy.

The initial pure-kernel Rust parity surface is:

- Rust-owned state-machine kernel inputs
- `@runxhq/core/policy`
- `@runxhq/core/policy/sandbox`
- authority-proof and scope-admission policy helpers
- public-work policy helpers
- graph-scope, retry, connected-auth, local-admission, and sandbox policy
  helpers

Parser, receipts, runtime, adapters, and CLI cutover are separate specs.
For any still-dual command, full CLI/runtime cutover still requires the
`fixtures/cli-parity` feature matrix and one-to-one parity evidence; kernel
parity alone is not a CLI or runtime cutover gate.

The Rust CLI cutover gate also requires the negative release-artifact verifier:

```bash
node scripts/check-rust-cli-cutover-negative.mjs --candidate <candidate-package-or-binary>
```

That verifier is read-only. It rejects candidate package or binary surfaces
that still expose JavaScript fallback hooks, retired receipt/legacy shapes, v2
alias modes, or hidden references to TypeScript runtime packages where static
inspection can see them. Passing the guard means the package surface delegates
to Rust cleanly; it does not authorize new command behavior by itself.

## Rust Dependency Policy

`crates/deny.toml` is the Rust workspace supply-chain boundary for the parity
track. It checks all feature graphs and currently has no package-specific
license exceptions.

The current tiers are:

- Pure crates: `runx-contracts`, `runx-core`, `runx-parser`, `runx-receipts`,
  and `runx-sdk` may not depend on async runtimes, HTTP clients/servers, MCP
  framework crates, or alternate YAML backends.
- Runtime and adapter crates: `runx-runtime` and `runx-cli` also have no
  approved `reqwest`, `hyper`, `tokio`, `rmcp`, `ureq`, `axum`, or
  `async-std` exception today. A future adapter-side exception must be
  spec-reviewed, package-scoped, and documented here before the deny entry is
  relaxed.
- YAML parsing: `serde_norway` is the current parser backend. `serde_yml` and
  `serde_yaml` are not approved Rust rewrite dependencies.
