# Thread Story Contract

The thread story is the reviewer-facing projection for source-thread driven
work. It is derived from receipts, scafld state, outbox entries, and provider
observations; it is not the source of truth.

## Current Shape

The shared implementation lives in `@runxhq/core/knowledge` as typed helpers:

- `buildThreadStoryMarkdown`
- `buildThreadStoryMessageOutboxEntry`
- `buildThreadStatusMarkdown`
- `buildThreadPullRequestReviewerPacketMarkdown`

Source-command normalization lives one layer earlier in `@runxhq/core/source`.
It supplies canonical source/thread locators, safe command summaries, target
repo hints, and dedupe keys that story builders may reference. It does not own
the durable reviewer projection, and it must not publish to Slack, GitHub, or
Sentry directly.

The thread outbox tools use those helpers to produce:

- `story.schema`: `runx.thread-story.control.v1`
- `story.data.thread_locator`
- `story.data.title`
- `story.data.next_action`
- `story.data.milestones`
- `outbox_entry.metadata.schema_version`: `runx.outbox-entry.message.v1`
- `outbox_entry.metadata.workflow`
- `outbox_entry.metadata.milestone_kind`
- `outbox_entry.metadata.body_markdown`

Provider publication is not owned by these helpers. Local file-thread outbox
pushes are credential-free persistence for fixtures and local dogfood. GitHub,
Slack, support-channel, or other provider mutations require the separate
`thread-outbox-provider-protocol-v1` lane and Rust-supervised credential
delivery; they must not be implemented as hidden `@runxhq/core` provider
side effects.

The canonical milestone kinds for issue-to-PR style flows are:

- `intake`
- `triage`
- `spec`
- `build`
- `review`
- `pull_request`
- `merge_gate`
- `outcome`

## Schema Decision

Keep the story as an internal typed helper plus stable outbox metadata for this
cut. Do not publish a standalone `@runxhq/contracts` schema yet.

That boundary is deliberate:

- current consumers are first-party tools and tests inside OSS runx
- the provider surface is the outbox entry, not a separate registry packet
- external adapters can already consume the rendered message and metadata
- delaying a public schema avoids freezing fields before live dogfood proves the
  final reviewer shape

Promote the packet to a public contract only when a non-tool consumer needs to
validate or exchange the story independently of the outbox entry. That promotion
must be a hard cut with call sites, docs, and tests updated in one change.

## Required Reviewer Sections

Public story markdown should summarize durable gates:

- source thread and request
- hydrated evidence status when adapter context was needed
- triage decision
- governed scafld task
- build result
- review verdict and finding counts
- PR link, branch, and base when known
- human merge gate
- observed merged or closed outcome

It should not publish low-level run events, full command dumps, raw provider
payloads, local absolute paths, token-shaped values, or consuming-repo policy
such as Slack channel names, Sentry project ids, or owner maps.

## Non-goals

- This contract does not admit Slack, Sentry, or support-channel messages.
- This contract does not push outbox entries to providers; provider mutation is
  blocked on `thread-outbox-provider-protocol-v1`.
- This contract does not decide whether an issue deserves a PR.
- This contract does not merge PRs.
- This contract does not replace receipts, ledgers, or scafld status.
- This contract does not encode Nitrosend, Aster, or runx.ai hosted policy.
