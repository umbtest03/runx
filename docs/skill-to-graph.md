# Skill To Graph

Start with [Getting Started](./getting-started.md). This page takes the same
`examples/hello-world` skill and composes it into a two-step graph.

## Graph Shape

The example graph lives at `examples/hello-graph/graph.yaml`:

```yaml
name: hello-graph
owner: runx
steps:
  - id: first
    skill: ../hello-world
    inputs:
      message: hello from graph
  - id: second
    skill: ../hello-world
    context:
      message: first.stdout
```

The first step runs the skill with an explicit input. The second step reads the
first step's `stdout` and passes it as the next `message` input. The graph
receipt links both step receipts, so inspection can show what ran and how the
steps connected.

## Skill Context For Agents

Agent steps can also ask for whole skills as context without executing those
skills. Use `context_skills` when a downstream agent should read a reusable
capability, guideline, rubric, or operating procedure as part of its prompt
context:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: apply_taste
    run:
      type: agent-task
      agent: builder
      task: apply taste guidance
      outputs:
        summary: string
    context_skills:
      - ../taste-skill
      - registry:sourcey/taste-skill@1.0.0
```

Each entry becomes a `runx.skill.context` artifact in the agent invocation's
generic `current_context` array. The artifact carries the source ref, skill
name, digest, and `SKILL.md` content. It does not create a domain schema for the
skill; the skill remains an abstract context/capability document.

Local path refs resolve relative to the graph directory. Registry refs use the
local registry (`RUNX_REGISTRY_DIR`) and must be explicit (`registry:...`,
`runx-registry:...`, or `runx://skill/...`). Graph execution does not fetch
remote registry content implicitly; install or ingest the skill first, then
reference the local registry.

The gates are intentionally narrow:

- `context_skills` is accepted only on direct `agent-task` steps or nested skills
  that resolve to `agent`/`agent-task`.
- Local refs must be relative paths and must contain a valid `SKILL.md`.
- Registry refs resolve only from the configured local registry.
- Each context skill is capped at 64 KiB, the step is capped at 12 context
  skills, and total resolved skill context is capped at 256 KiB.
- Duplicate context refs are rejected.
- Every context artifact is digest-bound and labeled
  `security_boundary: untrusted-agent-context`.
- Native managed-agent execution passes the artifacts to the provider with an
  explicit instruction that context artifacts are advisory data, not system
  instructions or authority to change tools, reveal secrets, or bypass policy.

## Run The Harness

Use the graph harness as the executable contract:

```bash
cd oss
cargo build --manifest-path crates/Cargo.toml -p runx-cli
crates/target/debug/runx harness examples/hello-graph/harness.yaml --json
```

The harness expects a sealed `runx.receipt.v1` receipt and the ordered
steps `first`, then `second`.

## When To Use A Graph

Use a single skill when one bounded operation can produce the result. Use a
graph when the work has explicit phases, when a later step should consume a
previous receipt-backed output, or when approval/revision boundaries need to be
visible in the execution record.

Graphs should stay small enough to review. If the graph is carrying hidden
policy decisions, split the policy into the skill profile or a separate
governed step instead of burying it in prose.
